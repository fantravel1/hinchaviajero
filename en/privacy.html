      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: Information We Collect ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Information We Collect</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">At HinchaViajero, we only collect the minimum information necessary to provide you with a better experience on our platform. Below, we detail the types of data we may collect:</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Email address</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address to send you updates about new guides, routes, and relevant content for traveling fans. Your email is stored securely and we never share it with third parties for commercial purposes.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Cookies and analytics data</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We use analytics cookies to understand how users interact with our site. These cookies collect information anonymously, including the pages you visit, how long you spend on each section, and how you arrived at our site. This information helps us improve our content and browsing experience.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">IP address and user agent</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">When you visit HinchaViajero, our servers automatically log your IP address and user agent information (browser type, operating system, and device). This data is used exclusively to ensure site security, prevent abuse, and generate aggregate traffic statistics.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: How We Use Your Information ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Newsletter</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Your email address is used to send you our newsletter with updates about new travel guides, documented stadiums, updated routes, and exclusive content for the traveling fan community. Every email includes an unsubscribe link so you can opt out at any time.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Site analytics</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Analytics data allows us to understand which guides are most consulted, which cities generate the most interest, and how to improve site navigation. This information is processed in aggregate form and is never used to identify individual users.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Content improvement</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Usage patterns help us prioritize which cities, stadiums, and routes to document next. If a guide receives many visits or if we detect that users are looking for information we don't yet offer, we work to create that content.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 3: Cookies and Similar Technologies ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">HinchaViajero uses cookies and similar technologies to improve your browsing experience. Below, we explain the types of cookies we use:</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Google Analytics</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics generates statistics about site visitors through the use of cookies. The generated information is stored on Google's servers. You can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's privacy policy</a> for more details on how Google processes this data.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Functional cookies</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We use functional cookies to remember your language preferences (Spanish or English) and other settings that improve your browsing experience. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and are strictly necessary for the proper functioning of the site.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">You can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. However, some site features may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: Sharing Information with Third Parties ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">At HinchaViajero, we do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for commercial or advertising purposes. Your trust is fundamental to us and protecting your data is a priority.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The only third parties with access to limited data are the analytics tools we use (such as Google Analytics) to measure site performance. These tools process data in aggregate and anonymous form, and are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">If required by law, we may disclose information if a competent authority requests it through a valid legal process. However, we are committed to notifying you if this occurs, whenever the law permits.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 5: Your Rights ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Your Rights</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">As a HinchaViajero user, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Request deletion of your data</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">You have the right to request the complete deletion of all personal data we have stored about you. To do so, send us an email at <a href="mailto:hola@hinchaviajero.com">hola@hinchaviajero.com</a> with the subject line "Data Deletion" and we will process your request within a maximum of 30 days.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 6: Data Security ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Data Security</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The security of your data is a priority for us. We implement the following measures to protect your information:</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Secure connection (SSL)</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">All traffic between your browser and our website is transmitted via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Encrypted storage</h3>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The personal data we store, such as our subscribers' email addresses, is kept on secure servers with encryption at rest. We limit access to this data exclusively to authorized personnel who need to process it for the purposes described in this policy.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">While we implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, no data transmission or storage system is 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:hola@hinchaviajero.com">hola@hinchaviajero.com</a>.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 7: Changes to This Policy ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Changes to This Policy</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our data collection practices, new site features, or legal requirements. When we make significant changes, we will post the updated version on this same page with the new update date.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We recommend reviewing this page periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Continued use of HinchaViajero after the publication of changes to this policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>
