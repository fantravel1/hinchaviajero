For high-demand fixtures like the Superclasico or Libertadores knockout rounds, tickets are virtually impossible without membership.

      <!-- ===== SECTION: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <p>El Monumental -- officially named <strong>Estadio Mas Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti</strong> -- is the largest and most important stadium in Argentina. Located in the residential neighborhood of Nunez in the northern part of Buenos Aires, it is the home ground of <strong>Club Atletico River Plate</strong>, one of the most successful and widely supported clubs in South American football history.</p>

        <p>With an approximate capacity of <strong>84,567 spectators</strong>, El Monumental is not just the biggest stadium in Argentina -- it is one of the largest in all of South America, rivaled only by the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. The stadium has served as the primary venue for the Argentine national team for decades, hosting World Cup qualifiers, Copa America matches, and friendlies against the biggest teams on the planet.</p>

        <p>What sets El Monumental apart from other great stadiums is its combination of sheer scale and emotional intensity. When 80,000 River Plate fans sing in unison -- particularly during a Copa Libertadores night under floodlights -- the experience is overwhelming. The sound does not hit you in sharp, violent bursts like La Bombonera's vertical vibration. Instead, it washes over you in waves: a deep, oceanic roar that comes from every direction and seems to have no beginning and no end.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"La Bombonera shakes. El Monumental roars. Both are cathedrals. The difference is scale. At El Monumental you feel like you are inside the lungs of an entire city breathing together."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the traveling fan, El Monumental offers something rare: a world-class stadium experience in a safe, accessible, and walkable neighborhood. Unlike many iconic stadiums in Latin America that sit in challenging or tense areas, the Nunez neighborhood around El Monumental is calm, residential, and well-connected by public transport. You can arrive early, walk the tree-lined streets, have a coffee, browse the pre-match stalls, and enter the stadium without stress. That ease of access, combined with the sporting spectacle inside, makes El Monumental one of the most rewarding stadium visits on the continent.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: HISTORY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="history">History</h2>

        <p>The story of El Monumental begins in the 1930s, when River Plate -- already one of Argentina's most powerful clubs -- outgrew their previous ground in the Alvear neighborhood. The club's leadership envisioned a stadium of unprecedented scale, one that would reflect River Plate's ambition and status. Architect Jose Aslan and engineer Hector Ezcurra were commissioned to design the new ground.</p>

        <p>Construction started in <strong>1935</strong>, and the stadium was officially inaugurated on <strong>May 25, 1938</strong>, with a match between Argentina and Uruguay. The original design featured a horseshoe-shaped bowl that could hold around 65,000 spectators -- an extraordinary number for the era, making it instantly the largest stadium in Argentina.</p>

        <h3>The 1978 World Cup</h3>

        <p>El Monumental's most famous moment on the global stage came on <strong>June 25, 1978</strong>, when it hosted the final of the FIFA World Cup. Argentina defeated the Netherlands 3-1 in extra time to win their first-ever World Cup, with Daniel Passarella lifting the trophy in front of a delirious crowd. The ticker-tape celebration that engulfed the stadium became one of the most iconic images in football history. To this day, the tradition of papel picado (confetti showers) at River Plate and Argentina matches traces its modern prominence to that night.</p>

        <p>For the 1978 tournament, the stadium underwent significant renovations: the upper tier was expanded, the capacity was pushed beyond 75,000, and the facilities were modernized to meet FIFA standards. These improvements transformed El Monumental from a large domestic ground into a genuine international venue.</p>

        <h3>Copa Libertadores and Continental Glory</h3>

        <p>El Monumental has hosted numerous Copa Libertadores finals and decisive matches throughout the decades. For River Plate fans, the ground represents the stage of their greatest continental triumphs -- and their most painful defeats. The 2018 Copa Libertadores final (second leg) against Boca Juniors was originally scheduled at El Monumental but was famously moved to Madrid after the River team bus was attacked by Boca fans en route to the stadium, resulting in one of the most surreal episodes in South American football history.</p>

        <p>River Plate's subsequent 2018 Libertadores victory in Madrid, and their 2015 triumph at home, cemented the club's status as one of the dominant forces in 21st-century South American football -- and El Monumental as their fortress.</p>

        <h3>The 2023 Renovation</h3>

        <p>The most recent and most ambitious transformation came in <strong>2022-2023</strong>, when River Plate embarked on a massive renovation project. The Siva (San Martin) stand was completely rebuilt, adding a new upper tier that pushed the capacity to approximately <strong>84,567 seats</strong>. The renovation also modernized the facilities: new concourses, improved accessibility, expanded concession areas, and state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems.</p>

        <p>The renovated stadium was renamed "Estadio Mas Monumental" as part of a naming rights agreement. Despite the corporate naming convention, everyone -- fans, media, taxi drivers -- still calls it simply "El Monumental."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">El Monumental has also hosted rugby internationals, concerts (Roger Waters, U2, The Rolling Stones), papal masses, and major political events. Its cultural significance extends well beyond football, making it one of the most important public gathering spaces in Argentine history.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: CAPACITY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="capacity">Capacity and Seating</h2>

        <p>With an approximate capacity of <strong>84,567 seats</strong>, El Monumental is the largest stadium in Argentina by a considerable margin. The second-largest, Estadio Unico Madre de Ciudades in Santiago del Estero, holds around 30,000 -- not even half. In the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, only La Bombonera (54,000) and El Cilindro (51,000) come close, and neither reaches two-thirds of El Monumental's size.</p>

        <h3>Stand Breakdown</h3>

        <p>The stadium maintains its classic horseshoe configuration with four main sections:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Belgrano Alta and Baja (North Stand):</strong> The traditional home end, where the most fervent River Plate supporters (the hinchada) congregate. This is the epicenter of the atmosphere. Belgrano Alta (upper) is general admission standing -- the cheapest ticket and the most intense experience. Belgrano Baja (lower) is also passionate but slightly more accessible.</li>
          <li><strong>San Martin (West Stand):</strong> The newly rebuilt stand from the 2023 renovation. Two tiers of seats with excellent sightlines. This is where many of the premium and corporate hospitality areas are located.</li>
          <li><strong>Centenario (South Stand):</strong> The curved end opposite Belgrano. A mix of seated sections. Good views, slightly less intense atmosphere than Belgrano but still loud and engaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Sivori (East Stand):</strong> Two tiers offering a good lateral view of the pitch. Popular with families and regular season-ticket holders who want a clear view of the full field.</li>
        </ul>

Avoid Centenario Baja if you are very short -- sightlines from the lower curved end can be partially obstructed.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: GETTING THERE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

        <p>El Monumental is located in the <strong>Nunez</strong> neighborhood, in the northern part of Buenos Aires. The address is <strong>Av. Presidente Figueroa Alcorta 7597</strong>. The area is well-connected by multiple forms of public transport, and on matchday the city typically adds extra services to handle the crowds.</p>

        <h3>By Train: Mitre Line (Tigre Branch)</h3>

        <p>This is the most popular option among fans. The <strong>Mitre train</strong> on the Tigre branch departs from <strong>Retiro station</strong> (one of the main terminals in downtown Buenos Aires) and stops at <strong>Nunez station</strong>, which is approximately a <strong>10-minute walk</strong> from the stadium gates. Trains run frequently on matchday, and the journey from Retiro takes about 20 minutes. After the match, expect crowded platforms -- arrive at the station early or wait 20-30 minutes for the crush to ease.</p>

        <h3>By Train: Belgrano Norte Line</h3>

        <p>The <strong>Belgrano Norte</strong> commuter train also has a stop at Nunez. This line connects the northern suburbs with the city and is an alternative if you are coming from the Belgrano or Vicente Lopez areas. The station is slightly farther from the stadium than the Mitre line stop, but still within a comfortable 15-minute walk.</p>

        <h3>By Subte (Metro)</h3>

        <p><strong>Subte Line D</strong> runs from the city center (Catedral station, near Plaza de Mayo) up to <strong>Congreso de Tucuman</strong>, which is the closest metro station to El Monumental. From Congreso de Tucuman, you have two options: a <strong>20-25 minute walk</strong> along Avenida Cabildo and then north toward the stadium, or a short bus ride (lines 29, 42, or 130) to cover the remaining distance. Line D is clean, frequent, and reliable.</p>

        <h3>By Bus (Colectivo)</h3>

        <p>Several bus lines pass near or directly by the stadium:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Line 29:</strong> Runs from La Boca through the city center to Nunez. Stops within a few blocks of the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 42:</strong> Connects Constitucion with Nunez. Stops on Av. del Libertador near the ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 107:</strong> Useful if coming from the Belgrano neighborhood.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 130:</strong> Runs from Retiro up through Nunez, stopping close to the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 15:</strong> Another option from the city center, with a stop on Av. Figueroa Alcorta.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember: all buses require the <strong>SUBE card</strong>. No cash, no boarding. Buy and top up your SUBE at any kiosk or metro station as soon as you arrive in Buenos Aires.</p>

        <h3>By Uber / Cabify / Taxi</h3>

        <p>Ride-hailing apps work well for getting to El Monumental. From the city center (Palermo, San Telmo, Microcentro), expect a fare of <strong>$5-12 USD</strong> depending on traffic and surge pricing. On matchday, traffic around the stadium gets heavy starting about 2 hours before kickoff. Ask your driver to drop you off on <strong>Av. del Libertador</strong> or <strong>Av. Udaondo</strong> and walk the last few blocks. After the match, surge pricing can spike -- consider walking 5-10 blocks away from the stadium before requesting a ride.</p>

            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The best strategy on matchday: take the <strong>Mitre train to Nunez</strong>, arrive 2-3 hours early, enjoy the pre-match atmosphere on foot, and after the match walk to Av. del Libertador to catch a ride-hailing app or bus. The train home is packed immediately after the final whistle -- waiting 20-30 minutes makes it much more bearable.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MATCHDAY EXPERIENCE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="matchday-experience">Matchday Experience</h2>

        <p>A matchday at El Monumental is an all-day event. It does not begin at kickoff and it does not end at the final whistle. For the full experience, you need to commit at least 5-6 hours -- and every minute is worth it.</p>

        <h3>Before the Match: The Previa</h3>

        <p>The pre-match ritual at El Monumental is centered around the streets north and west of the stadium, particularly along <strong>Av. del Libertador</strong> and the smaller streets between the stadium and the river. Starting 3-4 hours before kickoff, the neighborhood transforms:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choripan stalls</strong> line the sidewalks, filling the air with the unmistakable smell of grilled chorizo. This is the most Argentine pre-match ritual there is -- a choripan with chimichurri in one hand, a beer in the other, surrounded by fans in red and white.</li>
          <li><strong>Merchandise vendors</strong> sell flags, scarves, jerseys, and all manner of River Plate memorabilia from blankets laid on the sidewalk and makeshift stalls.</li>
          <li><strong>Bars along Av. del Libertador</strong> fill up with fans watching pre-match analysis on television, debating the lineup, and building the energy. These bars are the social gathering point -- friendly, loud, and welcoming to visitors who show respect for the club.</li>
          <li><strong>Drums and chanting</strong> start well before the gates open. Groups of fans (murgas) march toward the stadium singing the club's repertoire of chants. Joining in -- even if you do not know the words -- is part of the experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Entering the Stadium</h3>

        <p>Gates typically open <strong>2 hours before kickoff</strong>. Security checks are standard: pat-down, bag check, no bottles, no sharp objects, no large backpacks. You will need your <strong>ticket (digital or printed) and a valid ID</strong> (passport or national ID). The entry process is generally smooth but can get congested 30-45 minutes before kickoff at the busiest gates (Belgrano end).</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--warning">

            Prohibited items
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Leave at your accommodation: large bags, glass bottles, aerosol cans, umbrellas with pointed tips, professional cameras with detachable lenses, and anything that could be used as a projectile. Small bags and clear plastic bags are allowed. Bring cash for food and drinks inside -- most kiosks inside the stadium do not accept cards.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Inside the Ground</h3>

        <p>Once inside, the first impression is the scale. El Monumental is enormous -- the horseshoe shape means you can see the entire bowl stretching around you, with tier upon tier of red-and-white clad fans filling every seat. The Belgrano stand, where the barra brava (organized supporters) are based, begins their chanting display well before the teams emerge.</p>

        <p>When the teams walk onto the pitch, the stadium erupts. The recibimiento (welcome display) at El Monumental is one of the best in South America -- paper confetti (papel picado) rains down from every tier, flags the size of buildings are unfurled across entire stands, and the noise is physical. You do not just hear it; you feel it in your chest.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere remains intense throughout the 90 minutes. Argentine fans do not sit and watch quietly -- they sing for the entire match, with orchestrated chants that shift based on the scoreline, the referee's decisions, and the flow of play. Even during a 0-0 draw in a meaningless league fixture, the singing rarely stops.</p>

        <h3>After the Match</h3>

        <p>After the final whistle, the stadium empties gradually. If River win, expect an extra 10-15 minutes of celebration inside the ground before fans start moving. The exit process is orderly but slow due to the volume of people. Head to Av. del Libertador or Av. Udaondo for transport -- the choripan stalls will still be cooking, and the post-match atmosphere is relaxed and celebratory (after a win) or tense and silent (after a loss).</p>

        <h2 id="tickets">Tickets</h2>

        <p>Getting tickets to a River Plate match at El Monumental requires planning and awareness of how the Argentine ticketing system works. Here is the complete breakdown.</p>

        <h3>Price Ranges</h3>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>

                <td>$25 - 40</td>

              <tr>
                <td>Belgrano Baja (standing/seated)</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Centenario (seated)</td>
                <td>$35 - 55</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Sivori (seated)</td>
                <td>$40 - 60</td>
                <td>Side stand. Clear lateral view of the pitch.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>San Martin (seated / premium)</td>
                <td>$50 - 80</td>
                <td>Renovated stand. Best facilities. Premium sections higher.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Libertadores / high-demand match</td>
                <td>$60 - 120+</td>
                <td>Prices increase significantly for Libertadores knockout rounds and Superclasico.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>Prices vary depending on the opponent, competition, and demand. Regular league matches against mid-table teams are the cheapest and easiest to access. Copa Libertadores group stage matches are moderately priced. Libertadores knockout rounds, the Superclasico, and other high-profile fixtures are expensive and extremely difficult to get.</p>

        <h3>How to Buy</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Official website (cariverplate.com.ar):</strong> The primary channel. Members (socios) get priority -- tickets go on sale to members first, and a general-public quota opens later for lower-demand matches. You will need an Argentine ID or passport to register.</li>
          <li><strong>Stadium box office:</strong> For some matches, tickets are available at the stadium box office in the days before the match. Bring your passport. Opening hours vary -- check the club's social media for specific match information.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports tourism agencies:</strong> Authorized agencies offer packages for foreign tourists that typically include the ticket, transport to the stadium, and a bilingual guide. Prices range from <strong>$80-200 USD</strong> depending on the seat and the match. This is the most reliable option for high-demand fixtures if you are not a club member.</li>
        </ul>

            Never buy from resellers
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Street resellers outside the stadium, social media sellers, and unofficial websites are overwhelmingly scams. Counterfeit tickets are common and you will not be able to enter the ground. Worse, buying from resellers supports the same informal networks linked to the barras bravas. Stick to official channels or authorized agencies only.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food">Food and Drink</h2>

        <p>The food scene around El Monumental is one of the best of any stadium in Argentina, thanks to the combination of quality street food stalls and the solid restaurant infrastructure of the Nunez neighborhood.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Match Street Food</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choripan:</strong> The undisputed king. Grilled chorizo sausage split and served in crusty French bread, topped with chimichurri (parsley, garlic, olive oil, vinegar) or salsa criolla (diced onion, tomato, peppers). Every stall makes it slightly differently. The best stalls always have the longest queues. Budget: <strong>$2-4 USD</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Bondiola:</strong> Slow-roasted pulled pork in bread. Juicier and more substantial than choripan. Often served with the same sauces. Budget: <strong>$3-5 USD</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Hamburguesas:</strong> Many stalls also grill thick beef burgers. Quality varies -- stick to the stalls with visible flames and a queue. Budget: <strong>$3-5 USD</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Empanadas:</strong> Available from bakeries and stalls in the surrounding streets. Beef (carne), chicken (pollo), and ham-and-cheese (jamon y queso) are the most common. Budget: <strong>$1-2 USD each</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bars and Restaurants</h3>

        <p>Along <strong>Av. del Libertador</strong>, several blocks south of the stadium, there is a cluster of bars and restaurants that are the traditional pre-match gathering spots for River fans. These offer sit-down meals, cold beer, and televised pre-match coverage. Some popular options in the area include parrillas (Argentine grill restaurants) where you can get a steak and fries before the match, and pizza joints serving classic Argentine-style pizza. Expect to spend <strong>$8-20 USD</strong> for a proper sit-down meal with a drink.</p>

        <h3>Inside the Stadium</h3>

        <p>El Monumental has food and drink kiosks throughout the concourse areas. The selection is basic: sandwiches, empanadas, hot dogs, packaged snacks, soft drinks, and water. Beer is sometimes available inside, depending on the match and security regulations -- for certain high-risk fixtures, alcohol sales inside the stadium are suspended. Prices inside are higher than outside (roughly 30-50% markup), and queues can be long at halftime. The recommendation: eat well before you enter.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

        <p>El Monumental sits in one of the safest stadium neighborhoods in all of Argentine football. Nunez is a residential, middle-class area with tree-lined streets, schools, and family homes. It is not La Boca. It is not Avellaneda. The tension level is fundamentally lower, and for the traveling fan, this makes a significant difference to the overall experience.</p>

        <h3>General Safety Guidelines</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The neighborhood is safe before and after the match.</strong> You can walk freely in Nunez during the day and on matchday evenings. The main avenues (Figueroa Alcorta, del Libertador, Udaondo) are wide, well-lit, and heavily policed on matchday.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival team colors.</strong> This is a universal rule in Argentine football. Do not wear a Boca Juniors jersey (or any rival) anywhere near El Monumental, especially on matchday. Neutral clothing or River Plate gear only.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your phone and valuables secure.</strong> Petty theft (phone snatching) can happen in any crowded area in Buenos Aires. Keep your phone in your front pocket, avoid waving it around while walking, and be extra alert on public transport to and from the match.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid the Belgrano Alta section if you are uncomfortable with intense crowds.</strong> The standing sections in the upper Belgrano stand can get very crowded and physically intense. People push, jump, and press forward during celebrations. If you are claustrophobic or physically vulnerable, choose a seated section instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay away from the barra brava.</strong> The organized supporter groups have their designated areas within the Belgrano stand. As a visiting fan or tourist, keep a respectful distance. Do not photograph them without permission. Do not engage in confrontations. They are a reality of Argentine football, but they are not your scene.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps for late returns.</strong> If the match finishes late (midweek fixtures often kick off at 9:00 PM or later), take an Uber or Cabify back to your accommodation rather than walking to the train station. The wait may be slightly longer due to post-match surge, but it is worth the peace of mind.</li>
        </ul>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Currently, Argentine league football is played <strong>without visiting fans</strong> by AFA regulation. There is no away section at El Monumental (or any Argentine stadium). Everyone inside is a River Plate supporter. If you are a fan of the opposing team, attend with absolute discretion: no rival colors, no rival chants, no celebrating opposing goals. This is non-negotiable.</p>

The presentation is modern and well-curated, with interactive screens providing context for each trophy.</li>
          <li><strong>Pitch-side access:</strong> You walk down the tunnel and emerge at pitch level, with the empty (or partially empty) stadium rising around you. This is the moment that gives you goosebumps -- imagining 84,000 people filling those seats. Photography is allowed and encouraged.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing rooms:</strong> Access to the home dressing room, including the players' seats, the tactical board, and the shower area. A rare behind-the-scenes look at where the team prepares.</li>
          <li><strong>Press room:</strong> The room where post-match press conferences take place. You can sit at the podium and pretend you have just won the Libertadores final.</li>
          <li><strong>Historical exhibits:</strong> Rotating exhibitions covering significant moments in River Plate history, from the club's founding in 1901 to the latest triumphs. Significant attention is given to legendary players like Angel Labruna, Alfredo Di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli, and Marcelo Gallardo's tenure as manager.</li>

        <p>The Nunez area and its surroundings offer several interesting options for before or after the match, or on non-matchdays when you visit the museum.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Parque de la Memoria:</strong> A solemn and powerful memorial park along the Rio de la Plata riverfront, dedicated to the victims of state terrorism during Argentina's military dictatorship (1976-1983). Free entry. A 15-minute walk from the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Ciudad Universitaria:</strong> The University of Buenos Aires campus sits between the stadium and the river. Large green spaces, walking paths, and a peaceful atmosphere. Good for a pre-match walk.</li>
          <li><strong>Barrancas de Belgrano:</strong> A beautiful park in the neighboring Belgrano district, about a 20-minute walk or short bus ride south. Weekend craft fair, tango dancers, and tree-lined paths. A good spot to kill time before an evening kickoff.</li>
          <li><strong>Chinatown (Barrio Chino):</strong> Buenos Aires' small but vibrant Chinatown is in Belgrano, a few stops south on the Mitre train. Good for an affordable and different meal before heading to the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Costanera Norte:</strong> The riverside promenade north of the stadium. Popular for running, cycling, and walking. Several traditional parrilla restaurants along the road serve classic Argentine grill meals.</li>

                The safest route is through River Plate's official website (cariverplate.com.ar). Socios (members) get priority, but for regular league matches there is often a quota available for non-members. Tickets typically go on sale 3-5 days before the match. For high-demand fixtures like the Superclasico or Libertadores knockout rounds, tickets are virtually impossible without membership. Authorized sports tourism agencies are a viable alternative for foreign visitors, charging 80-200 USD for a package that includes the ticket, transport, and a guide.

                Yes. With a current capacity of approximately 84,567 seats, El Monumental is the largest stadium in Argentina and one of the largest in South America. After the most recent renovation completed in 2023, the stadium expanded its capacity and modernized its infrastructure while maintaining its iconic horseshoe shape.

On matchday, special bus services often run from central Buenos Aires. All public transport requires a SUBE card.

                Yes. The Museo River is open for visits on non-matchdays, typically from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The museum tour includes access to the trophy room, the pitch-side area, the tunnel, the changing rooms, and the press room. It is one of the best stadium tours in South America. Tickets can be purchased at the museum entrance or online. The tour lasts approximately 60-90 minutes.

                Yes. The Nunez neighborhood is one of the safest residential areas in Buenos Aires. Unlike some other stadium neighborhoods, Nunez is calm, well-lit, and comfortable for walking before and after the match. The main streets around the stadium (Av. Figueroa Alcorta, Av. Udaondo, Av. del Libertador) are wide and well-policed on matchday. Standard precautions apply: keep valuables secure, avoid flashing expensive items, and use ride-hailing apps for late-night returns.

                The classic pre-match meal is choripan (chorizo sausage in bread with chimichurri) from the street stalls that appear 3-4 hours before kickoff on the streets surrounding the stadium. Bondiola sandwiches and empanadas are also widely available. For a sit-down meal, the bars and restaurants along Av. del Libertador offer a more relaxed setting. Inside the stadium, there are food kiosks selling sandwiches, empanadas, and drinks, though queues can be long. Budget $5-10 USD for street food, $10-20 USD for a sit-down meal.

                For the most intense atmosphere, Belgrano Alta (upper north stand) is where the core supporters sing for 90 minutes nonstop. Be prepared for standing-only and physical intensity. For a balance of atmosphere and comfort, Sivori Alta or San Martin offer seated sections with excellent views. San Martin has the newest facilities after the 2023 renovation. Centenario is good but the curved angle can slightly affect sightlines from lower rows.

                It is extremely difficult. The Superclasico is the highest-demand match in Argentine football, and tickets are restricted almost exclusively to socios (members) with seniority. There is no away section (no visiting fans allowed). For tourists, the most realistic options are: an authorized sports tourism agency (expensive, $150-300+ USD), or experiencing the atmosphere from the bars and streets around the stadium without entering. Some agencies specialize in Superclasico packages -- book well in advance.
