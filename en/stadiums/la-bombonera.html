For non-members, a limited number of tickets are sometimes released for lower-demand league matches. For international tourists, the most reliable option is to book through an authorized sports tourism agency that includes tickets, transfer, and a guide. Prices range from 30 USD for a basic league seat to 100 USD or more for high-demand fixtures like Copa Libertadores nights. Never buy from street resellers or social media — scams are extremely common around La Boca."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <p>La Bombonera is not just a stadium. It is a physical phenomenon, a cultural landmark, and the spiritual home of one of the most passionate football clubs on earth. Officially named Estadio Alberto J. Armando, it sits at Brandsen 805 in the working-class neighborhood of La Boca, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is the home ground of Club Atletico Boca Juniors, the most popular club in Argentina and one of the most followed in the world.</p>

        <p>What sets La Bombonera apart from every other stadium on the continent is its architecture. The ground was designed by architect Viktor Sulcic with a unique asymmetric D-shape: three steep vertical tiers stacked on one side, and a single low stand on the other. This compact, vertical design creates an acoustic chamber effect that amplifies crowd noise to levels that defy the stadium's relatively modest capacity. When 49,000 fans jump in unison, the concrete structure vibrates. This is not metaphorical. Seismologists have measured the tremors. It is the only stadium in the world where the physical structure shakes under the force of its own supporters.</p>

        <p>Every major international journalist, every visiting player, every neutral observer who walks into La Bombonera for the first time says the same thing: no television broadcast, no YouTube video, no amount of reading can prepare you for the sensory overload of being inside this ground when it is full and singing. The sound hits you in the chest. The vibration rises through your legs. The confetti rains down so thick it blocks the floodlights. This is the place where football becomes something primal.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"La Bombonera does not shake. La Bombonera beats like a heart."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: HISTORY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="history">History</h2>

        <p>La Bombonera was inaugurated on May 25, 1940, during a match between Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo. The stadium was designed by architect Viktor Sulcic and engineers Jose Delpini and Raul Bes. The unique shape was not an aesthetic choice — it was a necessity. The plot of land available in the dense La Boca neighborhood was too small for a conventional oval stadium, so Sulcic designed the three-tiered vertical stand on one side to maximize capacity within the limited footprint. The result was a revolutionary asymmetric layout that became the stadium's signature.</p>

        <p>The nickname "La Bombonera" (the chocolate box) came from the resemblance of the tiered stands to the interior of a bonbon box, with layers stacked neatly on top of each other. The name stuck immediately and has been the stadium's identity ever since.</p>

        <p>Over the decades, La Bombonera has witnessed some of the most iconic moments in Argentine and South American football. It was here that Diego Maradona played some of his most memorable domestic matches. It was here that Juan Roman Riquelme, the quintessential Boca idol, orchestrated countless Copa Libertadores triumphs. Boca's six Copa Libertadores titles and three Intercontinental Cups were built on the foundation of La Bombonera's terrifying home advantage — visiting teams have historically been overwhelmed by the atmosphere before the ball is even kicked.</p>

        <p>The stadium has undergone several renovations since 1940, including expanded seating, modern facilities, and the addition of the Museo de la Pasion Boquense in 2001. Various expansion proposals have been debated over the years, but the limited space in the surrounding neighborhood makes significant enlargement extremely difficult. For now, La Bombonera remains at its current capacity — and many fans argue that its intimacy and compression are precisely what make it so fearsome.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            Historical note
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The stadium's official name honors Alberto J. Armando, the club president who oversaw the construction and was instrumental in Boca Juniors' growth during the mid-20th century. However, virtually nobody calls it by its official name. To every football fan on the planet, it is simply La Bombonera.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: CAPACITY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="capacity">Capacity and Layout</h2>

        <p><strong>Total capacity:</strong> 49,000 (approximately)<br>
        <strong>Seating configuration:</strong> Mixed (seated sections and standing terraces)<br>
        <strong>Pitch dimensions:</strong> 105m x 68m</p>

        <p>La Bombonera's layout is divided into distinct sectors that create very different matchday experiences depending on where you sit.</p>

        <h3>The Three-Tiered Stand (Tribuna)</h3>
        <p>The iconic side of the stadium. Three levels of concrete seating rise almost vertically from the touchline. The lower tier (Platea Baja) offers the closest views of the pitch. The middle tier (Platea Preferencial) is the most expensive and provides the best overall perspective. The upper tier (Platea Alta) is the furthest from the action but gives you a panoramic view of the entire ground and the La Boca rooftops beyond. The steepness of these tiers is startling — the upper level feels like it hangs directly over the pitch. This verticality is what creates the acoustic compression that makes La Bombonera so loud.</p>

        <h3>The Low Stand (Tribuna Popular)</h3>
        <p>The single-tier stand opposite the three-tiered side. This is the most affordable area and the one with the most intense atmosphere. It is largely a standing terrace, and it is where the general admission fans congregate. The sightlines are more limited, but the energy is raw and unfiltered.</p>

        <h3>Behind the Goals (Cabeceras)</h3>
        <p>The two ends of the stadium behind each goal. One of these is the legendary home of La 12, Boca's most famous barra brava. This end is a wall of noise, flags, drums, and bouncing fans from the first minute to the last. The opposite end is generally calmer, though still intense by any global standard. These sections are standing-only and are the cheapest in the ground.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10.29 3.86L1.82 18a2 2 0 0 0 1.71 3h16.94a2 2 0 0 0 1.71-3L13.71 3.86a2 2 0 0 0-3.42 0z"/><line x1="12" y1="9" x2="12" y2="13"/><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12.01" y2="17"/></svg>
            Choosing your section
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are a first-time visitor and want to experience the atmosphere without being in the most intense zone, aim for seats in the Platea Baja or Platea Preferencial on the three-tiered side. You will be close to the action with a great view and surrounded by passionate but generally seated fans. The standing sections behind the goals and the Tribuna Popular are louder and more physical — go there if you want the full immersion, but be prepared for tight spaces, constant jumping, and no personal space.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

        <p>La Bombonera is located in La Boca, a neighborhood in the southeastern part of Buenos Aires. The area is not directly served by the Subte (metro), so reaching the stadium requires a combination of public transport or a direct taxi/ride-hailing app.</p>

        <h3>By Bus (Colectivo)</h3>
        <p>The most common public transport route. Multiple bus lines pass near the stadium:</p>

          <li><strong>Line 29:</strong> Runs from Retiro through the city center to La Boca. Drops you on Almirante Brown, a 5-minute walk from the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 64:</strong> Connects several neighborhoods to La Boca. Stops near Brandsen street.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 152:</strong> A long route that passes through Palermo and the city center before reaching La Boca.</li>
          <li><strong>Line 53:</strong> From Constitucion and Barracas directly to La Boca.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All buses require a SUBE card (rechargeable transport card). If you do not have one yet, buy one at any kiosk or Subte station for less than 1 USD. You cannot pay cash on buses.</p>

        <h3>By Subte + Bus</h3>
        <p>Take Subte Line C to Constitucion station, then transfer to bus 29, 53, 64, or 152. Total journey from the city center: approximately 30-45 minutes depending on traffic.</p>

        <h3>By Subte + Walking</h3>
        <p>From Constitucion station, you can walk to La Bombonera in about 25-30 minutes. Many fans choose this route on matchday because it lets you absorb the pre-match atmosphere as you approach through the streets of La Boca. The walk is safe during daylight and on matchday when thousands of other fans are making the same journey. Stick to Avenida Almirante Brown and Brandsen.</p>

        <h3>By Taxi or Uber/Cabify</h3>
        <p>The most convenient option, especially after the match. From the city center (Microcentro, San Telmo), the ride takes 15-20 minutes without traffic. On matchday, expect significant congestion as you approach La Boca — drivers may drop you a few blocks away. Have Argentine pesos ready as some drivers prefer cash. After the match, pre-order your ride 10-15 minutes before the final whistle or walk a few blocks away from the stadium to find a pickup point with less congestion.</p>

        <h3>By Car</h3>
        <p>Driving to La Bombonera on matchday is not recommended. The streets around the stadium are closed to traffic hours before kickoff, and parking in La Boca is extremely limited and not safe for leaving your vehicle unattended. If you must drive, park in a secure garage in Barracas or San Telmo and take a taxi or bus the rest of the way.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at least 90 minutes before kickoff.

On Copa Libertadores nights, consider arriving 2 hours early.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MATCHDAY EXPERIENCE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="matchday-experience">Matchday Experience</h2>

        <p>A matchday at La Bombonera is not a sporting event. It is a full sensory experience that begins hours before kickoff and stays with you for the rest of your life. Here is what to expect.</p>

        <h3>The Build-Up (3-4 Hours Before Kickoff)</h3>
        <p>The streets around La Bombonera start filling up 3-4 hours before the match. Choripan stalls fire up their grills, merchandise sellers lay out their jerseys and scarves, and the first groups of fans begin congregating with speakers blasting Boca anthems. The smell of charcoal and grilled chorizo fills the air. On Brandsen street and along Avenida Almirante Brown, the atmosphere intensifies steadily. By two hours before kickoff, it is a full street party — flags, drums, chanting, and thousands of blue and gold jerseys converging on the stadium from every direction.</p>

        <h3>Entering the Stadium</h3>
        <p>Security checks at La Bombonera are thorough. You will be patted down and your bags searched. Prohibited items include: bottles, cans, sharp objects, large backpacks, professional cameras, and any rival team's merchandise. Bring only your ticket (digital or printed), your ID, cash for inside the stadium, and your phone. The entry gates can get crowded — be patient and keep your belongings secure.</p>

        <h3>Boca Juniors and the Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Once inside, you will understand why La Bombonera has the reputation it does. Even before kickoff, the three tiers are a wall of blue and gold. Giant flags (known as telones) are unfurled across entire sections. The drums start. The chanting starts. And it does not stop for 90 minutes. Boca fans do not sit down. They do not stop singing. They do not take breaks. The collective energy is something that has to be experienced physically — no recording captures the chest-rattling bass of 49,000 people bouncing on concrete.</p>

        <p>The moment the players emerge from the tunnel is the peak. Confetti cannons fire. Rolls of ticker tape are launched from every tier. The noise reaches a crescendo that genuinely hurts your ears if you are not prepared. Visiting players have openly admitted to being intimidated, disoriented, and unable to communicate with teammates during the first 15 minutes at La Bombonera.</p>

        <h3 id="la-12">La 12 — The Twelfth Player</h3>
        <p>La 12 is the name of Boca Juniors' main barra brava — the organized supporter group that occupies the lower tier behind one of the goals. The name refers to the concept of the fans being the "twelfth player" on the pitch. La 12 is responsible for the non-stop wall of sound, the enormous flags, the coordinated chants, and the relentless energy that defines La Bombonera's atmosphere.</p>

        <p>From a traveling fan's perspective, La 12's section is the epicenter of everything. The drumming, the bouncing, the flag-waving — it all originates from this end and radiates outward through the entire stadium. If you are seated in the three-tiered stand opposite, you will have a direct view of La 12 in full flow, which is a spectacle in itself. If you are in the standing sections nearby, you will feel the physical impact of thousands of people jumping in rhythm. La 12 does not stop. Not at 0-0, not at half-time, not when the team is losing. The singing is constant, creative, and at a volume that defies logic for a 49,000-capacity ground.</p>

            Important
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Do not attempt to enter La 12's designated section unless you are with local fans who know the area. These sections are controlled by the organized groups and outsiders are not welcome. As a foreign visitor, enjoy the atmosphere from the seated plateas or the general popular sections. This is not about danger — it is about respecting the established dynamics of the barra.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>After the Final Whistle</h3>
        <p>When the match ends (especially if Boca wins), the celebrations continue inside the stadium for 15-20 minutes. Fans stay to sing, the players do a lap of honor, and the atmosphere slowly winds down. Use this time to soak it in rather than rushing for the exit. When you do leave, head directly to a main avenue (Almirante Brown or Brandsen toward Barracas) and take a taxi, Uber, or bus. Do not linger in the darker side streets of La Boca after the match.</p>

        <h3>How to Buy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Official Boca Juniors website:</strong> Tickets are sold primarily to socios (club members). If you know a socio, they can potentially transfer their ticket to you for specific matches. Some low-demand league games release a non-member allocation.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports tourism agencies:</strong> The most reliable option for foreign tourists. Several authorized agencies in Buenos Aires offer matchday packages that include guaranteed tickets, round-trip transfer from your hotel, and a guide. These cost more, but eliminate the stress of navigating the ticket system in Spanish.</li>
          <li><strong>Hotel concierge:</strong> Some hotels in Buenos Aires have contacts who can source tickets. Quality and reliability vary widely.</li>
        </ul>

            Never buy from resellers
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Street resellers and social media sellers are rampant around La Boca and online. Fake tickets, inflated prices, and outright scams are extremely common. People have paid 100-200 USD for tickets that turned out to be photocopies. Only buy through official channels, authorized agencies, or trusted personal contacts. If a deal seems too good to be true, it is.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEARBY FOOD ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="nearby-food">Nearby Food</h2>

        <p>Eating around La Bombonera is part of the matchday ritual. The food scene splits into two categories: the street food that appears on matchday, and the permanent restaurants in the La Boca neighborhood.</p>

        <h3>Matchday Street Food</h3>
        <p>Starting 3-4 hours before kickoff, the streets around the stadium fill with mobile grills and food carts. These are the essential items:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choripan:</strong> Grilled chorizo sausage in crispy French bread, topped with chimichurri or salsa criolla. The undisputed king of Argentine matchday food. 3-5 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Bondiola:</strong> Slow-roasted pulled pork in bread. Juicier and more substantial than choripan. The stalls with the longest queues are always the best ones. 4-6 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Hamburguesas:</strong> Simple, greasy, satisfying. Some stalls offer them with a fried egg on top (a la caballo). 3-5 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Beer:</strong> Sold at kiosks and improvised stalls around the stadium. Quilmes (the national beer) and Brahma are the standards. 2-4 USD per can.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sit-Down Restaurants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>El Obrero:</strong> A legendary La Boca institution just a few blocks from the stadium. Traditional Argentine cuisine — steaks, pasta, milanesas — in a no-frills setting covered in Boca memorabilia. Visited by Bono, Roger Federer, and countless journalists. Arrive early as it fills up on matchday. Mains 10-20 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>La Perla:</strong> A traditional pizzeria on the corner of Avenida Almirante Brown and Suarez. Classic Buenos Aires pizza with thick, chewy dough. Open since the 1880s. A slice and a beer will cost you under 5 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Caminito restaurants:</strong> The tourist strip along Caminito has several restaurants serving parrilla (Argentine barbecue) and pasta. Prices are higher than neighborhood spots due to the tourist location, but the atmosphere is colorful and lively. Expect to pay 15-25 USD for a full meal.</li>
          <li><strong>Proa Cafe:</strong> Inside the Fundacion Proa arts center on Avenida Pedro de Mendoza. A more upscale option with terrace views over the Riachuelo river. Good for coffee and a light meal before heading to the stadium. 10-15 USD.</li>
        </ul>

            Cash only
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Nearly all street food stalls, kiosks, and smaller restaurants around La Bombonera only accept cash in Argentine pesos. ATMs in the area are scarce and often empty on matchday. Withdraw cash before you head to La Boca. Bring small bills — vendors often do not have change for large denominations.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

        <p>La Bombonera and its immediate surroundings are generally safe on matchday, but La Boca as a broader neighborhood requires awareness and precaution. Here are the key rules for the traveling fan.</p>

        <h3>Before the Match</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive during daylight or with the crowd.</strong> On matchday, the walk from the bus stop or Constitucion to the stadium is safe because thousands of fans are making the same journey. Do not arrive to La Boca alone at night for an evening kickoff — take a taxi directly to the stadium area.</li>
          <li><strong>Stick to main streets.</strong> Brandsen, Almirante Brown, Del Valle Iberlucea, and the streets immediately surrounding the stadium are well-policed on matchday. Do not wander into residential side streets away from the crowd.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival colors.</strong> Never, under any circumstances, wear a River Plate jersey (or any rival club's jersey) in La Boca. This is the single most important safety rule for the area. Even neutral jerseys from other Argentine clubs should be avoided. Wear Boca colors or plain clothes.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep valuables hidden.</strong> Phone in your front pocket. Do not flash expensive cameras or jewelry. Leave your passport at the hotel and carry a photocopy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inside the Stadium</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Follow instructions from security and stewards.</strong> They are there to keep things safe. Do not try to change sections or access areas you are not ticketed for.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> The atmosphere is physically demanding — jumping, singing, standing for 90 minutes in a packed crowd. Bring water (in a plastic bottle without the cap, or buy inside).</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your belongings secure.</strong> Pickpocketing can occur in crowded standing sections. Use a zipped pocket or a small crossbody bag worn in front.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After the Match</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leave promptly.</strong> Do not linger in the neighborhood after the match, especially for evening games. Head to a main avenue and take a taxi, Uber, or bus immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-order your ride.</strong> Request your Uber or Cabify 10-15 minutes before the final whistle, or walk a few blocks toward Barracas where pickup is easier.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel in groups.</strong> If you are with other travelers, stick together. There is safety in numbers, especially when moving through the neighborhood post-match.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SURROUNDING AREA — CAMINITO ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="surrounding-area">Surrounding Area — Caminito and La Boca</h2>

        <p>La Bombonera does not exist in isolation. It sits in the heart of La Boca, one of the most culturally significant neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. Visiting the stadium is best combined with exploring the surrounding area — ideally before the match, during daylight hours.</p>

        <h3 id="caminito">Caminito</h3>
        <p>Caminito is a pedestrianized street and open-air museum located just a few blocks from La Bombonera. It is the most photographed spot in Buenos Aires, famous for its brightly colored houses (conventillos), tango dancers, street artists, and murals. The street takes its name from the famous tango song "Caminito" by Juan de Dios Filiberto, who was inspired by the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>For the football fan, Caminito is inseparable from the Boca Juniors identity. The yellow and blue colors that dominate the neighborhood are Boca's colors (adopted from a Swedish ship's flag that docked at La Boca port in the early 1900s). The murals, the street art, the memorabilia shops — everything revolves around football and the club. You can buy replica jerseys, scarves, flags, and every imaginable piece of Boca merchandise from the stalls along Caminito.</p>

        <p><strong>When to visit:</strong> Caminito is best visited during daylight hours, ideally in the morning or early afternoon. On matchday, the area is lively but increasingly crowded as kickoff approaches. On non-matchday, it is a relaxed tourist experience with street performers and artists.</p>

        <h3>Museo de la Pasion Boquense</h3>
        <p>Located inside La Bombonera itself, this is one of the best football museums in South America. It covers the complete history of Boca Juniors with interactive exhibits, historical memorabilia, trophies, and video installations. The museum tour can be combined with a stadium tour that takes you through the tunnel, the dressing rooms, and onto the pitch. Open daily except on matchdays. Entry approximately 10-15 USD for foreign visitors.</p>

        <h3>Fundacion Proa</h3>
        <p>A contemporary arts center on Avenida Pedro de Mendoza, right by the old port area. Excellent rotating exhibitions of international art. The rooftop terrace cafe has views over the Riachuelo river and the old port cranes. A good contrast to the football intensity — ideal for a pre-match cultural stop.</p>

        <h3>La Vuelta de Rocha</h3>
        <p>The bend of the Riachuelo river where La Boca's port history is most visible. Old ships, iron bridges, and painted houses line the waterfront. It is photogenic and atmospheric, though some areas are run-down. Stick to the main pathway and the area near Caminito.</p>

            Perfect matchday itinerary
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">For an evening kickoff: arrive in La Boca around 2-3 PM. Walk through Caminito, visit the Museo de la Pasion Boquense, have lunch at El Obrero or one of the Caminito restaurants, then head to the stadium area by 5 PM for a 7 PM kickoff. This gives you the full La Boca cultural experience before the football takes over.</p>

        <h2 id="stadium-tour">Stadium Tour</h2>

        <p>If you cannot attend a live match — or even if you can and want the full behind-the-scenes experience — the La Bombonera stadium tour is highly recommended.</p>

        <h3>What Is Included</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Museo de la Pasion Boquense:</strong> The full museum experience covering Boca's history from its founding in 1905 by Italian immigrants to the present day. Trophies, historic jerseys, interactive displays, and video archives.</li>
          <li><strong>Pitch access:</strong> Walk through the players' tunnel and stand on the edge of the pitch. On a non-matchday, the empty stadium is almost eerie — the silence makes you appreciate the scale of the noise that fills it during a game.</li>
          <li><strong>Dressing rooms:</strong> See where the players prepare before walking out to face 49,000 people.</li>
          <li><strong>Press area and VIP boxes:</strong> A different perspective on the stadium's architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Panoramic views from the upper tiers:</strong> The stadium tour takes you to the highest points, offering a complete overview of the D-shaped design.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Price:</strong> Approximately 10-15 USD for foreign visitors. Prices are updated regularly — check the official Boca Juniors website for current rates.<br>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> 60-90 minutes for the full museum and stadium tour.<br>

                Tickets for Boca Juniors matches are primarily sold to socios (club members) through the official Boca Juniors website. For non-members, a limited number of tickets are sometimes released for lower-demand league matches. For international tourists, the most reliable option is to book through an authorized sports tourism agency that includes tickets, transfer, and a guide. Prices range from 30 USD for a basic league seat to 100 USD or more for high-demand fixtures like Copa Libertadores nights. Never buy from street resellers or social media — scams are extremely common around La Boca.

              <span>Is La Bombonera safe for foreign tourists?</span>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                La Bombonera and the immediate surroundings are safe on matchday due to a massive police presence. The Caminito tourist area is also safe during daylight hours. However, the broader La Boca neighborhood has safety issues, especially after dark. Stick to main streets, arrive early, and leave immediately after the match by taxi or ride-hailing app. Never wear a rival team's jersey (especially River Plate) anywhere near La Boca.

                Take Subte Line C to Constitucion station, then catch bus 29, 64, or 152 which drop you near the stadium entrance on Brandsen street. The total journey from the city center takes 30-45 minutes. Alternatively, take a taxi or Uber directly — it is 15-20 minutes from downtown without traffic, though expect heavy congestion on matchday. On match days, many fans walk from Constitucion station (about 25-30 minutes on foot), which lets you soak in the pre-match atmosphere.

                La 12 is the name of Boca Juniors' most famous barra brava (organized fan group). They occupy the lower tier behind one of the goals and are responsible for the non-stop singing, drumming, flag-waving, and the intense atmosphere that makes La Bombonera legendary. The name refers to being "the twelfth player" on the field. Their section is the loudest part of the stadium and the epicenter of the vibration La Bombonera is famous for.

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                Yes. La Bombonera offers guided tours through the Museo de la Pasion Boquense (Boca Juniors Museum) that include access to the pitch, the stands, the dressing rooms, and the press area. Tours run daily except on matchdays and cost approximately 10-15 USD for foreigners. The museum itself is excellent and covers the full history of the club. It is a must-visit even if you cannot attend a live match.

                The streets around La Bombonera fill with choripan (grilled chorizo sausage in bread) and bondiola (slow-roasted pulled pork) stalls 3-4 hours before kickoff. A choripan with a beer costs around 5-8 USD. For a sit-down meal, the pizzerias and parrillas along Caminito and Avenida Almirante Brown offer affordable Argentine classics. El Obrero, a few blocks from the stadium, is a legendary neighborhood restaurant popular with locals and visiting journalists alike.

You are allowed to bring a small bag, your phone, a plastic water bottle (without the cap in some cases), and cash. Security checks at the entrance are thorough — plan accordingly.

                Arrive at least 90 minutes before kickoff for a regular league match. For Copa Libertadores fixtures or high-demand games, aim for 2 hours before kickoff. This gives you time to pass through security, find your section, and experience the pre-match atmosphere inside the stadium as the chanting builds. If you plan to eat and explore the area first, arrive in La Boca 3-4 hours before the match to enjoy the full pre-match experience.
