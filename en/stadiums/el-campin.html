For regular Liga BetPlay matches, you can generally buy tickets on the day of the match, arriving 2-3 hours before kickoff. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico Capitalino, tickets sell out quickly and advance purchase is strongly recommended. Prices range from 10 to 30 USD depending on the section.

From Chapinero, the stadium is a 10-15 minute walk. SITP feeder buses also connect from neighborhoods not directly on the TransMilenio trunk lines. On matchday, expect heavier crowds at the Estadio station. Taxis and ride-hailing apps (Uber, DiDi, InDrive) from most parts of the city cost 2-5 USD."

The thin air means you will feel shortness of breath when jumping, singing, and celebrating. Arrive in Bogota at least 24 hours before the match to acclimatize. Drink plenty of water, eat light meals, and avoid heavy alcohol on your first day. Agua de panela (sugarcane water) and Sorojchi Pills (available at pharmacies) can help manage symptoms."

The stadium is centrally located in the Teusaquillo neighborhood, well-connected by public transport, and has significant police presence on matchdays.

      <!-- ===== SECTION: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <p>Estadio Nemesio Camacho, universally known as "El Campin," is the beating heart of football in Bogota. Sitting at 2,640 meters above sea level in the Teusaquillo neighborhood, this stadium has been the shared home of Millonarios FC and Independiente Santa Fe since 1938 — two clubs that happen to be the fiercest rivals in Colombian football. That improbable coexistence, where mortal enemies share the same dressing rooms and the same pitch, gives El Campin a character unlike any other ground on the continent.</p>

        <p>With a capacity of approximately 36,343 following its most recent renovation for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, El Campin is not the largest stadium in Colombia. Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Melendez in Barranquilla and Estadio Atanasio Girardot in Medellin rival it in size. But no other stadium in the country carries the same historical weight. El Campin has hosted Copa America finals, Copa Libertadores matches, international friendlies, and countless Liga BetPlay title deciders. Its concrete terraces have absorbed seven decades of goals, defeats, pitch invasions, celebrations, and the relentless singing of two fanbases who would sooner stop breathing than stop supporting their side.</p>

        <p>For the traveling fan, El Campin offers something genuinely special: the combination of altitude, atmosphere, and the raw intensity of Colombian football. The thin air at 2,640 meters gives visiting teams a physiological disadvantage and gives the crowd an almost desperate energy. When 36,000 people are singing in unison and you are gasping for breath between chants, you understand why they call Bogota one of the most difficult away-day destinations in South America.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"El Campin is not just a stadium. It is a contested territory. Every match, every weekend, it changes colors. On Saturday it might be blue from end to end for Millonarios. On Sunday it bleeds red for Santa Fe. The only constant is the noise, the altitude, and the empanadas."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: THE TWO CLUBS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="resident-clubs">The Two Clubs: Millonarios &amp; Santa Fe</h2>

        <p>Understanding El Campin means understanding the two clubs that share it. They are not simply co-tenants — they are adversaries bound together by geography, history, and an obstinate refusal to let the other claim the stadium as their own.</p>

        <h3 id="millonarios">Millonarios FC — The Blue Ballet</h3>

        <p>Founded in 1946, Millonarios FC is the most successful club in Bogota and one of the most decorated in Colombian football history. They have won 16 Liga Colombia titles, and their dominance in the early years of professional football earned them the legendary nickname "El Ballet Azul" (The Blue Ballet) during the 1950s, when the team featured Argentine superstars like Alfredo Di Stefano, Adolfo Pedernera, and Nestor Rossi. The "Ballet Azul" era remains one of the most celebrated chapters in South American football, and Millonarios fans carry that golden age as a badge of identity.</p>

        <p>The Millonarios fanbase is enormous. They draw the largest average attendance of any Bogota-based club and their supporters, known as "Embajadores" (Ambassadors), fill El Campin with a wall of blue on home matchdays. Their principal barra brava, Comandos Azules, occupies the south lateral stand and produces a relentless barrage of noise — drums, trumpets, choreographed chants, and the kind of coordinated jumping that makes the concrete stands vibrate under your feet. On big nights — Clasico Capitalino, Copa Libertadores, or title deciders — the atmosphere is genuinely breathtaking.</p>

        <h3 id="santa-fe">Independiente Santa Fe — The Cardinals</h3>

        <p>Founded in 1941, Independiente Santa Fe holds the distinction of being the oldest professional football club in Colombia. They have won 9 Liga Colombia titles and, critically, the 2015 Copa Sudamericana — the only international continental title won by a Bogota-based club. That achievement gives Santa Fe fans a powerful counter-argument whenever Millonarios fans cite their domestic title count.</p>

        <p>Santa Fe fans, known as "Cardenales" (Cardinals), are fiercely loyal and consider themselves the authentic soul of Bogota football. Their principal barra brava, La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur, occupies the north lateral stand at El Campin and matches Comandos Azules in intensity, volume, and sheer willpower. The red tide that floods El Campin on Santa Fe matchdays transforms the stadium into a completely different world compared to a Millonarios night — the colors, the chants, the energy all shift, yet the passion is identical.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Check the fixture list carefully before booking your trip. Millonarios and Santa Fe alternate home matches at El Campin, so the stadium might be hosting a blue night or a red night depending on the weekend. If you want to experience the Clasico Capitalino specifically, it typically happens twice per Liga BetPlay season (once per half) — plan well in advance as tickets sell out fast.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: CLASICO CAPITALINO ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="clasico-capitalino">The Clasico Capitalino</h2>

        <p>The Clasico Capitalino — Millonarios vs Independiente Santa Fe — is the oldest, most passionate, and most important derby in Colombian football. It has been played continuously since 1948, and the rivalry runs through every layer of Bogota society: through families, friendships, workplaces, taxi conversations, and the eternal question that every Bogotano faces at some point in their life: are you blue or red?</p>

        <p>On derby day, El Campin splits in half. The south lateral fills with blue. The north lateral fills with red. The general admission sections on either end become contested ground where the colors bleed together and the tension is palpable. Both barras bravas — Comandos Azules and La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur — pull out their full arsenal: massive banners, coordinated pyrotechnics (despite bans), drums that do not stop for 90 minutes, and choreographed displays that aim to demonstrate which fanbase owns the stadium.</p>

        <p>The match itself is always combative. Tackles fly, referees face impossible pressure, and the altitude ensures that by the final 15 minutes, players from both sides are running on pure adrenaline. For the traveling fan, attending a Clasico Capitalino is one of the essential experiences in South American football. The atmosphere is not on the level of Boca-River in terms of raw danger, but the passion, noise, and visual spectacle are absolutely world-class.</p>

            Clasico Capitalino safety
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">During the Clasico Capitalino, sections are strictly divided between Millonarios and Santa Fe supporters. Do not wear blue in the red sections or vice versa. If you are attending as a neutral, pick a side for the night, buy your ticket in that team's section, and behave accordingly. After the match, leave immediately and take a taxi or ride-hailing app. The streets around El Campin can be chaotic and tense when 36,000 emotionally charged fans pour out at the same time. Avoid lingering near the stadium exits.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: STADIUM LAYOUT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="stadium-layout">Stadium Layout &amp; Where to Sit</h2>

        <p>El Campin follows a traditional Latin American stadium layout: two lateral stands (north and south) running along the sidelines, and two curved ends (oriental and occidental) behind each goal. Understanding the sections is essential for choosing the right seat and avoiding uncomfortable situations.</p>

        <h3>Lateral Sur (South Stand)</h3>
        <p>This is the home of <strong>Comandos Azules</strong>, the principal barra brava of Millonarios. On Millonarios matchdays, this is the epicenter of the atmosphere. Standing for the entire match, non-stop singing, jumping, smoke, and noise. This section is not for the faint-hearted — it is physically demanding (especially at altitude) and the crowd is tightly packed. If you want the most intense Millonarios experience, this is where to be. However, as a foreign visitor, sit on the edges of this section rather than in the core if you are not comfortable with the intensity.</p>

        <h3>Lateral Norte (North Stand)</h3>
        <p>The mirror image for Santa Fe. <strong>La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur</strong> occupies this stand on Santa Fe matchdays. The same rules apply: intense, physical, loud, and not for everyone. The experience is extraordinary if you are prepared for it, but stick to the periphery if you are attending for the first time.</p>

        <h3>Oriental &amp; Occidental (East &amp; West Ends)</h3>
        <p>These are the more family-friendly sections, located behind the goals. They offer a good view of the pitch, a slightly calmer atmosphere, and assigned seating. These are the sections most recommended for visiting fans, tourists, and families. The oriental stand tends to have the better sightlines and is closer to the main entrance and transport connections. Ticket prices for these sections typically fall in the mid-range (15-25 USD).</p>

        <h3>Preferencial (VIP / Premium)</h3>
        <p>The premium sections are located in the central part of the western lateral stand. Padded seats, better concessions, and a more reserved atmosphere. Prices are higher (25-30 USD) but still remarkably affordable by international standards. This is the best option if you want a comfortable seat with an excellent view and do not want to stand for 90 minutes.</p>

            Best seat for first-timers
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If this is your first time at El Campin, go for the <strong>Oriental</strong> (east end) section. You get a full view of the pitch, you can see both barras in action across the stadium, the atmosphere is still excellent, and the seats are assigned so you do not need to arrive excessively early to secure a good spot. It is the sweet spot between comfort and experience.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: GETTING THERE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There: Transport to El Campin</h2>

        <p>El Campin is centrally located on Calle 57 with Carrera 30 (NQS), in the Teusaquillo neighborhood. This central position means excellent public transport access, but it also means significant traffic congestion on matchdays, especially in the final hour before kickoff.</p>

        <h3>TransMilenio (Bus Rapid Transit)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Estadio</strong> station on the Carrera 30 (NQS) corridor is the primary TransMilenio stop for El Campin. It drops you directly at the stadium entrance — you literally step off the bus and walk into the matchday atmosphere. The NQS line connects to the city's main TransMilenio corridors, so you can reach the stadium from almost any part of Bogota with one transfer at most. A single ride costs under 1 USD with a TuLlave card. On matchday, expect the Estadio station to be crowded in the 90 minutes before kickoff and immediately after the final whistle. Allow extra time and be vigilant about pickpockets in crowded stations.</p>

        <h3>SITP (Feeder Buses)</h3>
        <p>The SITP network of blue feeder buses complements TransMilenio and covers routes that the BRT trunk lines do not reach. Several SITP routes pass within walking distance of El Campin along Calle 57 and Carrera 30. These buses are slower but useful if you are coming from a neighborhood not directly connected to the NQS corridor. Pay with the same TuLlave card used for TransMilenio.</p>

        <h3>Walking from Chapinero</h3>
        <p>If you are staying in Chapinero — the recommended neighborhood for football fans — El Campin is a 10-15 minute walk west along Calle 57 or Calle 53. This is the most pleasant approach to the stadium: you walk through the tree-lined streets of Teusaquillo, pass through the growing crowd of fans, and absorb the pre-match energy as it builds. Just remember that at 2,640 meters, a 15-minute walk uphill can feel like 30 minutes if you have not acclimatized.</p>

        <h3>Taxis &amp; Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
        <p>Uber, DiDi, and InDrive all operate in Bogota. A ride from most central neighborhoods (Chapinero, Zona T, La Candelaria) to El Campin costs 2-5 USD. On matchday, request your ride well in advance — surge pricing can kick in, and traffic around Carrera 30 grinds to a halt in the final 30 minutes before kickoff. For the return journey, walk a few blocks away from the stadium before requesting a ride to avoid the worst of the post-match congestion.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport (El Dorado — BOG)</h3>
        <p>El Dorado International Airport is located west of the city center. A taxi to El Campin takes 30-50 minutes depending on traffic and costs approximately 10-18 USD (buy the fixed-fare ticket at the taxi counter inside the terminal). Ride-hailing apps are slightly cheaper. If you are heading directly from the airport to the match, give yourself at least 2 hours — Bogota traffic is unpredictable, and you do not want to miss kickoff because of a jam on the Calle 26 corridor.</p>

            Matchday transport warning
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Carrera 30 (NQS) is one of the busiest avenues in Bogota, and on matchday it becomes a bottleneck. If you are taking a taxi or ride-hailing app, plan to arrive at least 90 minutes before kickoff. If you are coming by TransMilenio, consider exiting one station early (CDS / Calle 63 or Simon Bolivar) and walking the rest of the way to avoid the crush at the Estadio station. After the match, walk north or south for 10 minutes before hailing a ride.</p>

        <h2 id="tickets">Tickets: How to Buy &amp; What to Pay</h2>

        <p>Tickets for matches at El Campin are affordable by international standards and, for most regular Liga BetPlay fixtures, readily available. Here is what you need to know.</p>

        <h3>Where to Buy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Official online platforms:</strong> Both Millonarios and Santa Fe sell tickets through platforms like TuBoleta. Check each club's official website for the current ticketing partner and match-specific links. Online purchases typically require a Colombian ID number, but some platforms accept passport numbers for foreign visitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Box office (Taquilla):</strong> El Campin has ticket windows that open on matchday, usually 3-4 hours before kickoff. For regular league matches, buying at the box office is straightforward — queues are manageable and availability is good. Bring cash in Colombian pesos (COP) as some windows do not accept cards.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid resellers:</strong> Street scalpers operate around El Campin on high-demand matchdays. Counterfeit tickets circulate. Do not buy from anyone who is not an official vendor. If the match is sold out through official channels, it is sold out — do not risk it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important: ID Requirement</h3>
        <p>Colombian stadiums require identification for entry. You must present a valid ID or passport that matches the name on your ticket. This policy was introduced to combat violence and ticket fraud, and it is strictly enforced. Keep your passport (or a copy) on you at all times on matchday.</p>

            Ticket strategy for tourists
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">For regular Liga BetPlay matches, buying at the box office on matchday is perfectly fine. Arrive 2-3 hours before kickoff, pick up your ticket, and spend the extra time soaking in the pre-match atmosphere. For the Clasico Capitalino or Copa Libertadores nights, buy online as soon as tickets go on sale — these matches can sell out days in advance. If the online platform does not accept your foreign ID, try going to the physical box office during the week before the match.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & DRINK ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-and-drink">Food &amp; Drink Around El Campin</h2>

        <p>The matchday food scene at El Campin is one of the best stadium experiences in South America. Starting 2-3 hours before kickoff, the streets surrounding the stadium transform into an open-air food market that is as much a part of the ritual as the match itself.</p>

        <h3>Street Food (La Previa)</h3>
        <p>The sidewalks along Carrera 30 and the blocks east of the stadium fill with vendors on matchday. The food is cheap, authentic, and deeply satisfying. Here is what to look for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Empanadas:</strong> Deep-fried corn pockets stuffed with seasoned potato and shredded meat, served with aji (spicy Colombian salsa). Less than 1 USD each. The quintessential matchday snack. Buy three, eat them standing up, and throw in some aji — you are now part of the ritual.</li>
          <li><strong>Arepas:</strong> Flat corn cakes that can be stuffed with cheese, eggs, or chicken. The arepa de choclo (sweet corn with melted cheese) is a Bogota specialty and costs around 1-2 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Chorizo:</strong> Grilled Colombian sausage, served on a stick or in a bun. The smell of chorizo on the makeshift grills is one of the defining scents of a Colombian matchday. Approximately 1-2 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Mazorca (grilled corn):</strong> Corn on the cob, grilled and slathered with butter, salt, and lime. Simple, cheap, and satisfying.</li>
          <li><strong>Mango with lime and salt:</strong> Sliced mango served in a bag with lime juice and salt. A refreshing contrast to all the fried food. Under 1 USD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ajiaco: The Bogota Classic</h3>
        <p>If you want a proper pre-match sit-down meal, seek out ajiaco — Bogota's signature dish. It is a thick, hearty soup made with three varieties of potato, shredded chicken, corn on the cob, capers, cream, and avocado. In the cool Bogota evening air, a bowl of ajiaco before heading to the stadium is one of the great pleasures of a Colombian matchday. Restaurants along Carrera 13 in Chapinero and the traditional spots in Teusaquillo serve excellent versions for 4-7 USD.</p>

        <h3>Drinks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poker beer:</strong> The ubiquitous beer of Bogota. Light, cheap, and sold everywhere around El Campin from street vendors and makeshift stalls. Under 1 USD per bottle.</li>
          <li><strong>Aguardiente:</strong> Colombia's national anise-flavored sugarcane spirit. Drunk in shots from communal bottles shared among friends. It burns going down and warms you up in the cold Bogota night air. Essential to the pre-match ritual, but pace yourself — altitude amplifies the effects of alcohol.</li>
          <li><strong>Agua de panela:</strong> Warm sugarcane water with lime. Non-alcoholic, cheap, and widely believed to help with altitude adjustment. Sold at street stalls everywhere. Drink it early in your trip.</li>
          <li><strong>Tinto:</strong> Small, sweet Colombian black coffee. Available on every street corner for a few cents. The fuel of daily Bogota life.</li>
        </ul>

            Alcohol and altitude
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Alcohol hits significantly harder at 2,640 meters above sea level. Dehydration from drinking amplifies altitude sickness symptoms — headaches, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Go easy on the aguardiente and beer before the match, especially if you arrived in Bogota within the last 24 hours. Hydrate with water and agua de panela between drinks. Save the serious drinking for the post-match celebration, when you are safely off your feet.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: ALTITUDE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="altitude">Altitude: The Invisible Factor at 2,640 Meters</h2>

        <p>Altitude is not a footnote at El Campin — it is the defining characteristic of the entire experience. At 2,640 meters (8,660 feet) above sea level, the air contains approximately 25% less oxygen than at sea level. This is not an abstraction. You will feel it. Every visiting fan feels it.</p>

        <p>The symptoms of altitude sickness — known locally as "soroche" — include headaches, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. These symptoms are manageable in normal daily activity, but they are amplified dramatically when you are jumping, singing, clapping, and celebrating in a football stadium for 90 minutes. Fans who arrive from sea-level cities like Cartagena, Barranquilla, or international destinations and go straight to El Campin often find themselves sitting down by halftime, unable to keep up with the crowd.</p>

        <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive 24-48 hours early:</strong> Give your body time to begin acclimatizing. Do not fly in from a sea-level city and head straight to the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrate aggressively:</strong> Drink 3-4 liters of water per day from the moment you arrive. Dehydration makes altitude symptoms dramatically worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Eat light:</strong> Heavy meals — especially the tempting bandeja paisa — can make you sluggish and nauseous when combined with altitude. Opt for ajiaco or a light meal before the match.</li>
          <li><strong>Limit alcohol on day one:</strong> A couple of beers is fine. A pre-match binge session at altitude is a recipe for a terrible night.</li>
          <li><strong>Agua de panela:</strong> The local remedy. Warm sugarcane water with lime, sold everywhere. Whether it genuinely helps or works as a placebo, it is part of the Bogota experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorojchi Pills:</strong> Available over the counter at any Colombian pharmacy. They contain aspirin, caffeine, and salofene, formulated specifically for altitude sickness. Pop one before the match if you are feeling rough.</li>
          <li><strong>Pace yourself in the stands:</strong> You do not need to jump for 90 minutes. The lateral sections demand it, but the oriental and occidental sections allow you to sit, catch your breath, and enjoy the match at your own rhythm.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MATCHDAY EXPERIENCE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="matchday-timeline">The Matchday Experience: A Timeline</h2>

        <p>A proper matchday at El Campin is not a 90-minute event — it is a half-day immersion. Here is how to structure it for maximum enjoyment.</p>

        <h3>3 Hours Before Kickoff</h3>
        <p>Start your pre-match in Chapinero. Grab a bowl of ajiaco at a traditional restaurant on Carrera 13, or eat an early empanada at one of the street stalls that are already setting up along Calle 57. Hydrate. Check your ticket, make sure you have your passport, and leave unnecessary valuables at the hotel.</p>

        <h3>2 Hours Before Kickoff</h3>
        <p>Walk toward the stadium along Carrera 30. The atmosphere is building now: vendors are grilling chorizo, fans are arriving in team colors, the first drums are beating, and the police presence is visible. If you need to pick up your ticket at the box office, now is the time. Stop at a street stall for empanadas and a Poker beer. Absorb the scene.</p>

        <h3>90 Minutes Before Kickoff</h3>
        <p>Enter the stadium. Security checks are thorough but move reasonably fast. No bottles, no cans, no sharp objects. Once inside, find your seat or standing spot and settle in. Watch the barras set up their banners and flags. The stadium is still filling up, and this is a great time to take in the architecture and the view of the Andes rising behind the western stands.</p>

        <h3>30 Minutes Before Kickoff</h3>
        <p>The atmosphere shifts. The barras are now in full voice. Drums are pounding, chants are building, flags are waving, and the stands are packed. If you are in the lateral sections, you are already standing and the energy is pulling you in. This is when El Campin feels electric.</p>

        <h3>Kickoff to Final Whistle</h3>
        <p>The match itself. At El Campin, the crowd does not stop for 90 minutes. The singing is constant, the reactions to every tackle and every shot are visceral, and the altitude gives everything a raw, breathless edge. Enjoy it, but listen to your body — if you are feeling lightheaded, sit down and drink water.</p>

        <h3>After the Match</h3>
        <p>Leave promptly. Do not linger near the exits where the crowd is densest. Walk north or south along Carrera 30 for 10 minutes to find a calmer spot to hail a taxi or request a ride-hailing app. The neighborhoods of Chapinero and Zona T have bars open late if you want to continue the night. If you are returning to La Candelaria, take a taxi — do not attempt to walk.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety at El Campin</h2>

        <p>El Campin is generally safe for visiting fans who follow standard precautions. The stadium is centrally located, well-policed on matchdays, and the surrounding Teusaquillo neighborhood is one of the more respectable areas in Bogota. That said, it is still a large football stadium in a major Latin American city, and the usual rules apply.</p>

        <h3>Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrive early and leave promptly after the match.</li>
          <li>Keep your phone in your front pocket or inside your jacket. Phone theft is the most common crime in Bogota.</li>
          <li>Carry cash in small denominations — most vendors around the stadium are cash-only.</li>
          <li>Take a taxi or ride-hailing app home after the match rather than walking through unfamiliar streets.</li>
          <li>Stay in well-lit, populated areas before and after the match.</li>
          <li>Bring a rain jacket — Bogota weather can change rapidly, and night matches in the rainy season (April-May, October-November) often get wet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do Not</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not wear the wrong team's colors in the wrong section, especially during the Clasico Capitalino.</li>

          <p class="info-box__text">As a foreign visitor at El Campin, you are generally not a target for fan-related aggression. Colombian fans are typically curious and welcoming toward international visitors who show respect for their club and their culture. If you engage with fans in the stands, a simple "de donde eres?" (where are you from?) can lead to a wonderful conversation, shared beers, and an invitation to join the chanting. Just be respectful, be genuine, and enjoy the hospitality.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: HISTORY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="history">A Brief History of El Campin</h2>

        <p>El Campin's story begins in 1938, when the stadium was inaugurated to host the Bolivarian Games — a multi-sport event celebrating the 400th anniversary of Bogota's founding. The stadium was built on the grounds of the Hacienda El Campin, a former country estate on what was then the outskirts of the city, and the name stuck despite the official designation "Estadio Nemesio Camacho" (honoring a Colombian sports figure).</p>

        <p>In its early years, El Campin was a modest ground, but the explosion of professional football in Colombia in the late 1940s and 1950s transformed it into a national stage. Millonarios' "Ballet Azul" era drew record crowds, and the stadium underwent its first major expansions to accommodate the growing demand. Santa Fe, the older club, had already been using the stadium since the early 1940s, and the coexistence of both clubs under one roof was established from the earliest days of professional Colombian football.</p>

        <p>El Campin has been renovated multiple times throughout its history. The most significant overhaul came in preparation for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which Colombia hosted. The stadium received new seats, improved facilities, a modernized press box, and enhanced safety infrastructure. The capacity was reduced from its historical peak (closer to 45,000 in the pre-renovation era) to the current ~36,343, with improved sightlines and comfort.</p>

        <p>Key moments in El Campin's history include Copa America group-stage matches, numerous Copa Libertadores nights, and the countless Liga Colombia title deciders that have made the stadium hallowed ground for both Millonarios and Santa Fe fans. The stadium has also hosted concerts, religious events, and political gatherings, but football is and always has been its primary purpose.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEARBY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="nearby">What Is Nearby</h2>

        <p>El Campin sits in an excellent location for visitors. The surrounding area offers plenty to do before and after the match, and the connections to Bogota's main entertainment and cultural districts are strong.</p>

        <h3>Parque Simon Bolivar</h3>
        <p>A short walk south of El Campin, this massive urban park is Bogota's answer to Central Park. On non-matchday weekends, it fills with joggers, families, and cyclists. On matchday, it is a common gathering point for fans heading to the stadium. The park is safe during the day and pleasant for a pre-match stroll.</p>

        <h3>Chapinero</h3>
        <p>East of El Campin, Chapinero is the ideal neighborhood for football fans. Excellent restaurants (try the ajiaco spots on Carrera 13), craft beer bars, bookshops, and a vibrant nightlife scene. Chapinero Alto, the uphill section closer to the Andes, has a bohemian, artsy atmosphere. After the match, Chapinero is where you want to be — the bars stay open late and the streets are well-lit.</p>

        <h3>Zona T / Zona Rosa</h3>
        <p>About 20 minutes north of El Campin by taxi, this is Bogota's upscale entertainment district. Restaurants, clubs, and shopping along the T-shaped pedestrian street at Calle 82 and Carrera 13. Safe, well-policed, and lively after dark. A good option for a post-match dinner or night out.</p>

        <h3>Gaira Cafe (formerly Gaira Cafe Cumbia House)</h3>
        <p>A famous live-music venue in the Zona T area, founded by Colombian musician Carlos Vives. If your match is on a Friday or Saturday night, a post-match trip to Gaira for live cumbia and vallenato is an unforgettable way to end the evening.</p>

                Tickets are sold through official club channels. Millonarios and Santa Fe both use platforms like TuBoleta for online sales, and tickets are also available at the El Campin box office windows on matchday. For regular Liga BetPlay matches, you can generally buy tickets on the day of the match, arriving 2-3 hours before kickoff. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico Capitalino, tickets sell out quickly and advance purchase is strongly recommended. Prices range from 10 to 30 USD depending on the section. Always bring a valid ID or passport, as it is required for entry.

                The easiest way is TransMilenio, Bogota's bus rapid transit system. The "Estadio" station on the Carrera 30 (NQS) corridor drops you directly at the stadium entrance. From Chapinero, the stadium is a 10-15 minute walk. SITP feeder buses also connect from neighborhoods not directly on the TransMilenio trunk lines. On matchday, expect heavier crowds at the Estadio station. Taxis and ride-hailing apps (Uber, DiDi, InDrive) from most parts of the city cost 2-5 USD.

                Almost certainly, especially if you are arriving from a sea-level city. El Campin sits at 2,640 meters (8,660 feet) above sea level. The thin air means you will feel shortness of breath when jumping, singing, and celebrating. Arrive in Bogota at least 24 hours before the match to acclimatize. Drink plenty of water, eat light meals, and avoid heavy alcohol on your first day. Agua de panela (sugarcane water) and Sorojchi Pills (available at pharmacies) can help manage symptoms.

                Yes, El Campin is generally safe for visitors. The stadium is centrally located in the Teusaquillo neighborhood, well-connected by public transport, and has significant police presence on matchdays. Standard precautions apply: arrive early, stick to main approaches, keep valuables out of sight, and take a taxi or ride-hailing app home after the match rather than walking unfamiliar streets at night. During the Clasico Capitalino, avoid wearing the wrong team's colors in the wrong section.

                The streets surrounding El Campin transform on matchday with dozens of vendors selling empanadas, arepas, grilled corn, chorizo, and mango with lime and salt. Beer (Poker) and aguardiente are widely available from street vendors. For a sit-down meal, walk to the restaurants along Carrera 13 in Chapinero for ajiaco (Bogota's signature potato and chicken soup) or bandeja paisa. Most food around the stadium costs 1-3 USD per item. Cash in Colombian pesos is essential — street vendors do not accept cards.

                If you are attending the Clasico Capitalino as a neutral, you must pick a side for the night. The stadium is divided strictly between Millonarios (blue) and Santa Fe (red) sections, and there is no neutral zone. Buy your ticket in one team's section and commit to it. Wear the appropriate colors or go in plain clothes. Do not attempt to sit in the middle or switch sides. Both fanbases are passionate and the atmosphere will be electric regardless of which side you choose.

Bottles, cans, umbrellas, and any sharp objects are prohibited. Phone cameras are fine, but professional cameras with detachable lenses may be confiscated at the gate unless you have press credentials. Leave anything you do not absolutely need at your hotel to speed up the entry process.

                Bogota's weather is consistently cool due to the altitude, with temperatures typically ranging from 8-15 degrees Celsius (46-59 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. Rain is common, especially during the wet seasons (April-May and October-November). Bring a jacket or hoodie for night matches — the temperature drops noticeably after sunset, and the concrete seats do not retain heat. A compact rain jacket is a smart addition to your matchday kit. Despite the cool weather, the crowd generates its own heat once the match begins.
