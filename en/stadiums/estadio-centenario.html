Avoid the popular sections behind the goals (barras bravas territory) unless you are comfortable in densely packed standing areas.

For a proper pre-match experience, organize an asado (barbecue) with friends or fellow hostel travelers — the Uruguayan asado is a sacred Sunday ritual. Mate (herbal infusion) is everywhere and is the quintessential matchday drink. You can also find beer vendors near the stadium. Inside the ground, food options are basic — eat before you enter."

The Tribuna America, opposite the Olimpica, is also good. Avoid the popular sections (Tribuna Colombes and the ends behind the goals) unless you want an intense, standing-only, densely packed fan experience. During the Clasico, each end is assigned to one team's supporters and the atmosphere is extreme. The platea sections along the sides are the safest bet for a great view without the crush."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Why Visit Estadio Centenario?</h2>

        <p>On July 30, 1930, 68,346 people crammed into a stadium that had been built in just eight months on the edge of a park in Montevideo. Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2, and the first-ever FIFA World Cup was won. The trophy was lifted, the crowd erupted, and a sport that had been growing in pockets around the world was suddenly, irreversibly, a global phenomenon. Every World Cup that has been played since — from Italy 1934 to the present day — traces its lineage back to this ground. Estadio Centenario is not just a stadium. It is the genesis point of the most popular sporting event on earth.</p>

        <p>In 1983, FIFA recognized this unique status by declaring the Centenario a Historic Monument of World Football — the only stadium in the world to hold this distinction. The designation places it alongside the most culturally significant sporting venues on the planet, and for the traveling football fan, it transforms a visit from a simple matchday into a pilgrimage.</p>

        <p>But the Centenario is not a museum piece collecting dust. It remains an active, working stadium — the home ground of the Uruguayan national team, the venue for the biggest editions of the Clasico between Nacional and Peñarol, and the stage for Copa Libertadores knockout matches that shake the foundations of Parque Batlle. On a full-house night, with 60,000 Uruguayans singing under the floodlights, the Torre de los Homenajes looming overhead, and the scent of grilled chorizo still hanging in the evening air, the Centenario delivers an experience that is simultaneously historic and viscerally alive.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Other stadiums are louder. Others are bigger. Others are newer. But no stadium in the world carries the weight of history that the Centenario does. Walking through its gates is walking through the door where modern football began."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the visiting fan, the Centenario offers something that the Maracana, the Azteca, and La Bombonera cannot: the feeling of standing at the exact point where it all started. Combined with Montevideo's compact size, affordable prices, and deeply passionate football culture, a trip to the Centenario is one of the most rewarding experiences available to any traveling supporter on the continent.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: HISTORY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="history">History</h2>

        <h3>The 1930 World Cup and the Birth of a Legend</h3>

        <p>When FIFA awarded the first World Cup to Uruguay in 1929, the country had fewer than two million inhabitants and no stadium large enough to host the tournament. The solution was audacious: build a brand-new stadium from scratch, on a previously undeveloped section of Parque Batlle, in time for the opening match. The architect, Juan Scasso, designed a modernist bowl with a distinctive tower — the Torre de los Homenajes — that would rise 100 meters above the main stand as a tribute to Uruguayan football's centenary of independence.</p>

        <p>Construction began in February 1930. Despite heavy winter rains that turned the site into a mud pit and logistical delays that would have derailed any modern project, the stadium was substantially complete by mid-July. It was not fully finished for the opening match of the tournament — the first World Cup games were played at other Montevideo grounds, including Gran Parque Central and Estadio Pocitos — but by the time the semifinals and final arrived, the Centenario was ready.</p>

        <p>The final, played on July 30, 1930, between Uruguay and Argentina, remains one of the most celebrated matches in football history. Argentina led 2-1 at half-time, but Uruguay stormed back in the second half, scoring three goals to win 4-2. The crowd, which had arrived by foot, horse-drawn cart, automobile, and train from across the country, celebrated through the night. The next day, a national holiday was declared. The Centenario had been open for less than two weeks, and it was already immortal.</p>

        <h3>The Golden Era and Beyond</h3>

        <p>The Centenario went on to host numerous Copa America tournaments, South American Championship matches, and the defining moments of Uruguayan club football throughout the 20th century. It was at the Centenario that Nacional and Peñarol played their most iconic Clasicos, that Uruguay prepared for their miraculous Maracanazo victory at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, and that generations of Uruguayan footballers — from Jose Nasazzi and Hector Scarone in the 1930s to Enzo Francescoli in the 1980s and Luis Suarez in the 2000s — played their most important domestic and international matches.</p>

        <p>The stadium has undergone several renovations over the decades, including significant modernization work in the 1980s and 2000s that improved seating, lighting, and facilities while preserving the original architectural character. Today, the official capacity stands at 60,235, and the ground continues to serve as the beating heart of Uruguayan football.</p>

        <h3>The Torre de los Homenajes</h3>

        <p>The most recognizable feature of the Centenario is its tower — the Torre de los Homenajes (Tower of Tributes). Rising from the center of the main stand (Tribuna Olimpica), it was designed to celebrate the centenary of Uruguayan independence (1830-1930) and to serve as a beacon visible across Montevideo. Today, the tower houses the Museo del Futbol (Football Museum) and has become the symbol of the stadium itself. When Uruguayans refer to the Centenario, the image in their minds is always the tower, standing sentinel over the pitch like a lighthouse over the sea.</p>

        <h2 id="heritage">UNESCO &amp; FIFA Heritage Status</h2>

        <p>In 1983, FIFA formally designated Estadio Centenario as a Historic Monument of World Football. This makes it the only stadium on the planet to carry this distinction — a recognition of its unmatched role in the birth of the World Cup and the globalization of football as a sport.</p>

        <p>The heritage status is not merely symbolic. It places the Centenario in a category alongside the most culturally important sporting venues in history and has been instrumental in driving preservation efforts and government investment in the stadium's maintenance. For the traveling fan, it adds an additional layer of significance to every visit: you are not just attending a football match, you are stepping inside a protected monument to the sport's history.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: THE 1930 WORLD CUP ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="world-cup-1930">The 1930 World Cup</h2>

        <p>The first FIFA World Cup was a tournament unlike anything that came after it. Only 13 teams participated — four from Europe (France, Belgium, Romania, Yugoslavia), who made the two-week sea crossing to Montevideo — alongside teams from the Americas. There were no qualifiers, no global broadcast, and no commercial sponsors. It was football in its purest and most pioneering form.</p>

        <p>The tournament was played across three venues in Montevideo: Estadio Pocitos, Gran Parque Central, and the Centenario itself. The early group-stage matches took place at the smaller grounds while workers raced to finish the Centenario. By the time the semifinals arrived, the stadium was ready, and all remaining matches were played there.</p>

        <p>Key matches at the Centenario during the 1930 World Cup:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Semi-final: Argentina 6 - 1 United States</strong> — July 26, 1930. Argentina dismantled the surprisingly strong American team in front of a packed house.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-final: Uruguay 6 - 1 Yugoslavia</strong> — July 27, 1930. The host nation crushed the Europeans to set up the all-South American final.</li>
          <li><strong>Final: Uruguay 4 - 2 Argentina</strong> — July 30, 1930. The match that changed everything. Uruguay trailed at half-time, then scored three second-half goals to claim the first-ever World Cup. 68,346 spectators witnessed history.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Walking into the Centenario on a modern matchday, knowing that you are standing where Hector Castro scored the fourth goal to seal the 1930 final, where Jose Nasazzi lifted a trophy that had never existed before, and where the entire concept of a football World Cup was proven viable — that knowledge transforms the experience from a sporting event into something closer to a pilgrimage.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TEAMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="teams">Who Plays Here</h2>

        <h3>Uruguay National Team</h3>

        <p>The Centenario is the official home of La Celeste — the Uruguay national football team. All FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Copa America home matches, and major international friendlies are played here. For a country of 3.5 million people, Uruguay's international football record is staggering: two World Cup titles (1930, 1950), 15 Copa America titles (the most of any nation), and a consistent ability to produce world-class talent that punches far above the country's weight.</p>

        <p>Attending a Uruguay qualifier at the Centenario is an unforgettable experience. The crowd is united, passionate, and deeply knowledgeable about the game. The garra charrua — the fighting spirit that defines Uruguayan football — is palpable in the stands. When the anthem plays and 60,000 voices sing as one, you understand why this tiny nation keeps producing Suarez, Cavani, Forlan, and Valverde.</p>

        <h3>Nacional (El Clasico at the Centenario)</h3>

        <p>Club Nacional de Football, founded in 1899, uses Gran Parque Central as their regular home ground. However, for the biggest editions of the Clasico against Peñarol and for Copa Libertadores knockout matches requiring larger capacity, Nacional plays at the Centenario. Nacional fans (the Bolsos) fill their assigned half of the stadium with a sea of red, white, and blue, and their organized supporters create a wall of noise from the popular terraces.</p>

        <h3>Peñarol (El Clasico at the Centenario)</h3>

        <p>Club Atletico Peñarol, founded in 1891, now has their own modern stadium — Campeon del Siglo — in the Sayago neighborhood. But like Nacional, they use the Centenario for the Clasico and other high-demand fixtures. Peñarol fans (the Carboneros) bring a gold-and-black wall of flags, banners, and drums that transforms their end of the Centenario into a cauldron. For the traveling fan, attending a Clasico at the Centenario is the pinnacle of the Montevideo football experience.</p>

Choose your side before you arrive and stick with it. Do not attempt to sit in the wrong section. Arrive at least 2-3 hours before kickoff, as security checks are thorough and lines are long. After the final whistle, follow the crowd flow and leave the area promptly. Do not wear any team colors on public transport after the match.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: GETTING THERE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There — Parque Batlle</h2>

        <p>Estadio Centenario is located in Parque Batlle (formerly Parque de los Aliados), a large green area in the geographic center of Montevideo. The park is bounded by two major avenues — Av. 8 de Octubre to the north and Bulevar Artigas to the south — both of which are major bus corridors. The stadium's address is Av. Dr. Americo Ricaldoni s/n, but on matchday you will not need an address: just follow the stream of fans heading toward the Torre de los Homenajes.</p>

        <h3>By Bus</h3>

        <p>Montevideo's bus network is the most practical way to reach the Centenario. You need an STM card (Montevideo's contactless transport card) to ride any city bus — purchase and top up at Abitab or RedPagos kiosks throughout the city. A single ride costs approximately 0.80 USD.</p>

        <p>Key bus routes to the Centenario:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>From Ciudad Vieja / Centro:</strong> Lines 104, 306, 405, and several others run along Av. 8 de Octubre past the stadium. Travel time: 20-30 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>From Pocitos:</strong> Walk through Parque Batlle (20 minutes on foot) or take buses along Bulevar Artigas. The walk through the park on matchday, joining the growing river of fans, is part of the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>From Tres Cruces bus terminal:</strong> Multiple bus lines connect the terminal to the Parque Batlle area. Travel time: 10-15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On matchday, bus frequency increases on the main routes serving the stadium area. After the match, expect crowded buses and potential waits — consider walking to a stop further from the stadium or using a taxi.</p>

        <h3>By Taxi / Uber</h3>

        <p>Taxis are metered and affordable. From Ciudad Vieja or the Centro, a taxi to the Centenario costs approximately 5-8 USD. From Pocitos, 4-6 USD. Uber also operates in Montevideo and offers similar pricing. Both are excellent options for the return trip after night matches, when walking through quiet streets is less advisable.</p>

        <h3>On Foot</h3>

        <p>If you are staying in Pocitos, Parque Batlle, or Cordon, walking to the Centenario is not only possible but recommended. The walk from Pocitos through the park takes about 20 minutes and is one of the best pre-match rituals in South American football. You will pass families setting up barbecues, kids kicking balls, fans gathering in groups with thermoses of mate, and street vendors firing up their grills. By the time you arrive at the stadium, you are already immersed in the atmosphere.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">You cannot board a Montevideo city bus without an STM card. Buy one as soon as you arrive in the city — available at the Tres Cruces bus terminal, the Buquebus ferry terminal, Abitab kiosks, and RedPagos outlets. Load it with at least 5-10 USD of credit for a few days of bus rides. The card also gives you discounted transfers between bus lines within a two-hour window.</p>

        <h3>Where to Buy</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stadium box office:</strong> For most regular matches, tickets go on sale at the Centenario's own ticket windows 2-3 hours before kickoff. This is the most straightforward method for league matches.</li>
          <li><strong>RedPagos and Abitab:</strong> These payment-service outlets are found on almost every block in Montevideo and often sell match tickets for high-demand fixtures. Check availability a few days before the match.</li>
          <li><strong>Club websites:</strong> For the Clasico, Nacional and Peñarol sell their allocation of tickets through their official websites. You may need a Uruguayan ID or club membership for certain sections.</li>
          <li><strong>AUF (Uruguayan Football Association):</strong> National team match tickets are sold through the AUF website and at authorized outlets.</li>
        </ul>

            Never buy from street resellers
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Counterfeit tickets are a known problem at high-demand matches in Montevideo, especially during the Clasico. Never buy from unofficial vendors outside the stadium. If the box office is sold out, check RedPagos or Abitab — or accept that this particular match was not meant to be. Getting turned away at the gate with a fake ticket is far worse than missing a match.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SECTIONS & SEATING ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="seating">Stadium Sections &amp; Where to Sit</h2>

        <p>The Centenario is divided into four main stands (tribunas), each with a different character and price point. Understanding the layout will significantly improve your matchday experience.</p>

        <h3>Tribuna Olimpica (Main Stand)</h3>
        <p>The iconic stand beneath the Torre de los Homenajes. This is the best section for views, comfort, and historical significance — you are sitting directly below the tower that defines the stadium. The Olimpica has numbered seating and is generally the most expensive section. This is the recommended choice for visiting fans who want a great view and a calmer (but still passionate) atmosphere.</p>

        <h3>Tribuna America</h3>
        <p>The stand opposite the Olimpica. Good views of the pitch and slightly cheaper than the main stand. A solid choice for fans who want a good seat without paying top prices. Numbered seating, decent sightlines.</p>

        <h3>Tribuna Colombes</h3>
        <p>One of the two end sections (behind the goals). Named after the Colombes stadium in Paris where Uruguay won Olympic gold in 1924. During the Clasico, this end is assigned to one team's supporters and is a standing-only, densely packed, intensely loud experience. Only recommended if you are comfortable in a barra-adjacent environment.</p>

        <h3>Tribuna Amsterdam</h3>
        <p>The other end section, named after the Amsterdam stadium where Uruguay defended their Olympic title in 1928. Same character as Colombes — standing popular section, assigned to the opposing team during the Clasico. Intense, loud, and not for the faint-hearted.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            Best section for visiting fans
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are a neutral visiting fan or a tourist, the Tribuna Olimpica or Tribuna America are your best options. You get numbered seats, good views, and a passionate but manageable atmosphere. If you have picked a side and want to experience the terraces, go to the end assigned to your chosen team — but be prepared for a standing, packed, intensely vocal experience with no personal space. Keep valuables secure and your phone out of sight in the popular sections.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: ASADO PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="previa">The Asado Previa (Pre-Match Ritual)</h2>

        <p>In Montevideo, the pre-match experience — la previa — is centered around food, mate, and community. It is not the explosive, flare-filled chaos of Buenos Aires or the samba-infused party of Rio. It is quieter, warmer, more communal, and deeply rooted in the Uruguayan asado tradition.</p>

        <h3>Street Food Around the Stadium</h3>

        <p>On matchday, the streets around Parque Batlle transform into an open-air food market. Vendors set up portable grills along Av. Ricaldoni and the park's main paths, filling the air with the smoke and aroma of grilling meat. The staples:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choripan:</strong> Grilled chorizo in a bread roll. The universal South American matchday food. 2-4 USD from a street vendor.</li>
          <li><strong>Hamburguesas al paso:</strong> Simple, grilled burgers. Cheap and filling. 3-5 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Panchos:</strong> Hot dogs, Uruguayan style. Sometimes topped with everything imaginable. 2-3 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Beer:</strong> Street vendors sell cans and bottles. Patricia and Pilsen are the most common Uruguayan brands. 2-3 USD per can.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Asado Ritual</h3>

        <p>If you want the authentic Montevideo pre-match experience, organize an asado. In the park itself, in a hostel courtyard, or at a local friend's house, the asado is the centerpiece of the Uruguayan Sunday. Beef ribs, chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes vegetables are cooked slowly over wood or charcoal. The grill master (asador) takes pride in their craft, and the process is unhurried — the asado starts 3-4 hours before the match and serves as both meal and social event. Mate is passed around constantly, beers are opened, and the conversation inevitably turns to football.</p>

        <p>Many hostels in Pocitos, Ciudad Vieja, and Cordon organize group asados on weekends — ask at reception. If you are invited to a local's asado, bring wine (tannat, Uruguay's signature grape) and arrive hungry. It is one of the most genuine cultural experiences Montevideo offers.</p>

        <h3>Mate</h3>

        <p>You will see mate everywhere on matchday. Uruguayans carry their thermos of hot water and their mate gourd to the stadium as naturally as they carry their ticket. The herbal infusion is the social glue of Uruguayan life, and sharing mate is a gesture of friendship and inclusion. If someone offers you a sip, accept it — and do not say thank you until you are done (saying "gracias" signals that you do not want any more). On the walk through Parque Batlle to the stadium, every other person will have a thermos under their arm. It is one of those details that makes Montevideo's football culture feel unique.</p>

            Eat before you enter
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Food and drink options inside the Centenario are basic and limited — a few kiosks selling sandwiches, snacks, and soft drinks. The real eating happens outside, in the park and on the surrounding streets, before the match. Arrive at least two hours early to enjoy the previa, eat your fill, and soak in the atmosphere before passing through the security checks.</p>

        <h2 id="museum">Museo del Futbol (Football Museum)</h2>

        <p>Inside the Torre de los Homenajes, the Centenario houses one of the most important football museums in the world. The Museo del Futbol chronicles the history of Uruguayan football, the 1930 World Cup, and the broader story of South American football with a collection of memorabilia, photographs, trophies, and audiovisual materials that would make any fan's heart race.</p>

        <h3>What You Will See</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>The 1930 World Cup collection:</strong> Original match balls, jerseys worn by players in the final, photographs from the construction of the Centenario, and press clippings from around the world covering the tournament.</li>
          <li><strong>Uruguay's World Cup triumphs:</strong> Detailed exhibits on both the 1930 victory and the legendary Maracanazo of 1950, when Uruguay defeated Brazil in the World Cup final at the Maracana in front of almost 200,000 spectators.</li>
          <li><strong>Nacional and Peñarol history:</strong> Memorabilia from both clubs, including Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup trophies, jerseys, and historical footage.</li>
          <li><strong>Uruguayan football legends:</strong> Galleries dedicated to the greatest players in Uruguayan history — from Jose Nasazzi and Obdulio Varela to Enzo Francescoli, Diego Forlan, and Luis Suarez.</li>
          <li><strong>The tower itself:</strong> Climbing the Torre de los Homenajes offers views over the pitch and across the Montevideo skyline. Standing at the top of the tower that has overlooked every major match played at the Centenario since 1930 is a powerful moment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Weekdays (Monday-Friday), typically 10:00 - 17:00. Some Saturdays. Closed on matchdays and the day before major matches (the stadium is being prepared).</li>
          <li><strong>Entry fee:</strong> Approximately 3-5 USD. Guided stadium tours (including pitch, changing rooms, and press area) cost an additional 5-8 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Plan 1-2 hours for the museum alone, or 2-3 hours if you add the stadium tour.</li>
          <li><strong>Language:</strong> Most exhibits are in Spanish, but the visual materials (photographs, jerseys, trophies) speak for themselves regardless of language. Some guided tours are available in English if booked in advance.</li>

          <p class="info-box__text">Even if you are attending a match at the Centenario, visit the museum on a separate day. The matchday experience and the museum experience complement each other perfectly — the museum gives you the historical context that transforms a football match into a pilgrimage. Going to the Centenario without visiting the Museo del Futbol is like going to the Colosseum without learning about the gladiators.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

        <p>The Parque Batlle neighborhood surrounding the Centenario is residential, green, and generally calm. The stadium itself is well-policed on matchday, and the overall risk level for visiting fans is lower than at many South American grounds. That said, the standard rules of South American football safety apply.</p>

        <h3>General Rules</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival colors.</strong> If you are going to a Nacional match, do not wear gold or black. If Peñarol is playing, avoid red, white, or blue combinations. If it is a national team match, Celeste (sky blue) is the only acceptable color. When in doubt, wear neutral colors.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep valuables hidden.</strong> Phone in your front pocket, wallet secure, no flashy jewelry or watches. This applies anywhere in South America, not just at the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid the popular sections unless you know what you are getting into.</strong> The ends behind the goals (Colombes and Amsterdam) are where the barras bravas (organized fan groups) operate. These sections are standing-only, extremely crowded, and intensely passionate. They are not inherently dangerous, but they are not the place for a first-time visitor who is unsure of the dynamics.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early, leave promptly.</strong> Get to the stadium 90 minutes to 2 hours before kickoff to clear security and enjoy the atmosphere. After the match, leave with the crowd flow and exit the area within 15-20 minutes. Do not linger in the streets around the stadium after a high-intensity match.</li>
          <li><strong>Use taxis or Uber for night matches.</strong> The walk through Parque Batlle is beautiful during the day and on a crowded matchday evening, but after a night match when the crowds have dispersed, take a taxi or Uber back to your accommodation.</li>
          <li><strong>Carry a passport copy.</strong> Some ticket windows and stadium security may ask for identification. Leave the original at your accommodation.</li>
        </ul>

            About barras bravas
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Both Nacional and Peñarol have organized supporter groups (barras bravas) that control the popular ends of the stadium. These groups are territorial and can be unpredictable. As a tourist or visiting fan, the platea sections (side stands) are always the safest and most comfortable choice. If you want the terrace experience, go with a local who knows the section and the dynamics. Never photograph barra members without permission, and never enter a section that is not on your ticket.</p>

        <p>For a backpacker, a complete Centenario matchday experience — bus to the stadium, choripan and beer in the park, a standing ticket, and a bus back — can be done for under 20 USD. For a more comfortable experience with a platea seat and a taxi ride, plan for 35-45 USD. Either way, it is a fraction of what you would pay for a comparable experience in Europe.</p>

        <h2 id="matchday">Matchday Timeline</h2>

        <p>Here is the ideal matchday schedule for a visiting fan attending a Sunday afternoon match at the Centenario (the most common slot for Uruguayan league fixtures).</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>4-5 hours before kickoff:</strong> Start your asado, if you have organized one. Otherwise, head to Mercado del Puerto in Ciudad Vieja for a parrilla lunch with a medio y medio.</li>
          <li><strong>3 hours before kickoff:</strong> Make your way toward Parque Batlle. If walking from Pocitos, enjoy the stroll through the park. If taking a bus, board early to avoid the rush.</li>
          <li><strong>2-2.5 hours before kickoff:</strong> Arrive in the streets around the stadium. Browse the food vendors, grab a choripan, join the growing crowd. The atmosphere builds gradually — this is la previa.</li>
          <li><strong>90 minutes before kickoff:</strong> Head toward the gates. Security checks can take 15-30 minutes depending on the match. Bags are searched, and certain items (bottles, cans, large banners without authorization) are confiscated.</li>
          <li><strong>60 minutes before kickoff:</strong> Find your seat or spot on the terrace. Watch the stands fill. Listen to the chants begin. Feel the energy rise.</li>
          <li><strong>Kickoff:</strong> Experience the full force of 60,000 voices. The Centenario on a full night is something you will remember for the rest of your life.</li>
          <li><strong>Final whistle:</strong> Exit with the crowd flow. Head to the main avenues (8 de Octubre or Bulevar Artigas) for buses, or walk to a pre-arranged taxi/Uber pickup point. Do not linger.</li>
          <li><strong>Post-match:</strong> Head to a bar in Pocitos or Ciudad Vieja to decompress, discuss the match, and toast to the experience. Montevideo's bar scene is lively after football.</li>

                For most matches, tickets are sold at the stadium box office on matchday starting 2-3 hours before kickoff. For high-demand matches like the Clasico (Nacional vs Peñarol) or Uruguay national team qualifiers, tickets may be sold through the home club's official website, AUF (Uruguayan Football Association), or at RedPagos and Abitab outlets across Montevideo. Prices range from 8 to 25 USD for regular league matches and 20 to 50 USD for derbies and internationals. Bring cash in Uruguayan pesos and a passport copy. Never buy from unofficial street resellers.

                Estadio Centenario was declared a Historic Monument of World Football by FIFA in 1983, making it the only stadium in the world with this distinction. While it is not on UNESCO's World Heritage List in the traditional sense, FIFA's designation recognizes its unique historical significance as the venue where the first-ever FIFA World Cup final was played on July 30, 1930. The stadium is widely referenced as a UNESCO-level cultural heritage site for world football.

                Yes. The Museo del Futbol (Football Museum) inside the Torre de los Homenajes is open on weekdays and some Saturdays. The museum covers the 1930 World Cup, Uruguay's two World Cup triumphs, and the broader history of South American football. Guided stadium tours are also available and include access to the pitch, changing rooms, press area, and the tower itself. Tours typically cost around 3-5 USD. Check hours in advance, as the museum may close on days when the stadium is being prepared for matches.

                Multiple bus lines serve the Parque Batlle area where the stadium is located. Key routes run along Av. 8 de Octubre and Bulevar Artigas. From Ciudad Vieja or the Centro, buses 104, 306, and 405 pass within walking distance. From Pocitos, it is a 20-minute walk through the park. You need an STM card to ride buses — available at Abitab and RedPagos kiosks. Taxis from the Centro cost 5-8 USD. Uber also operates. On matchday, extra bus services are common.

                Yes. The Parque Batlle neighborhood surrounding the stadium is residential and generally calm. On matchday, police presence is strong. Standard precautions apply: do not wear rival team colors near the stadium, keep valuables hidden, and use taxis or ride-hailing apps for the return trip after night matches. Avoid the popular sections behind the goals (barras bravas territory) unless you are comfortable in densely packed standing areas. The platea (side stands) and upper tiers are the safest and most comfortable options for visiting fans.

                The streets around Parque Batlle come alive with food vendors on matchday. Choripan (grilled chorizo sandwich) and hamburgers are the most common street food, costing 3-5 USD. For a proper pre-match experience, organize an asado (barbecue) with friends or fellow hostel travelers. Mate (herbal infusion) is everywhere and is the quintessential matchday drink. You can also find beer vendors near the stadium. Inside the ground, food options are basic — eat before you enter.

                For visiting fans and tourists, the Tribuna Olimpica (main stand beneath the Torre de los Homenajes) offers the best views and the most comfortable experience. The Tribuna America, opposite the Olimpica, is also good. Avoid the popular sections (Tribuna Colombes and the ends behind the goals) unless you want an intense, standing-only, densely packed fan experience. During the Clasico, each end is assigned to one team's supporters and the atmosphere is extreme. The platea sections along the sides are the safest bet for a great view without the crush.
