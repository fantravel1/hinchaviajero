      <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <p>There are stadiums, and then there is the Azteca. Situated in the Coapa neighborhood in southern Mexico City, Estadio Azteca is not merely a football ground -- it is a living monument to the history of the sport. Opened on May 29, 1966, it was designed by architects Pedro Ramirez Vazquez and Rafael Mijares Alcerrega with one purpose: to give Mexico a stadium worthy of hosting a World Cup. It did exactly that. Twice.</p>

        <p>With an official capacity of <strong>87,523</strong>, Estadio Azteca is the <strong>only stadium in the world to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals</strong> -- the 1970 final where Pele's Brazil dismantled Italy 4-1, and the 1986 final where Diego Maradona's Argentina defeated West Germany 3-2 to lift the trophy. No other venue on the planet can claim that distinction. The Maracana hosted one final. Wembley hosted one final. The Azteca hosted two, and in between them witnessed perhaps the single greatest individual performance the sport has ever seen.</p>

        <p>But this stadium is not frozen in history. It is alive every other weekend when <strong>Club America</strong>, Mexico's most successful and most controversial club, fills it for Liga MX matches. It roars when <strong>El Tri</strong>, the Mexico national team, plays World Cup qualifiers here, turning the altitude and the noise into a weapon that visiting teams dread. It shakes during the <strong>Clasico Nacional</strong> -- America versus Chivas -- the most-watched football match on the continent.</p>

        <p>The name itself comes from Aztec culture, honoring the civilization that once ruled the Valley of Mexico where the stadium now stands. The locals call it <em>El Coloso de Santa Ursula</em> -- the Colossus of Santa Ursula -- after the neighborhood that surrounds it. And colossus is the right word. When you approach the Azteca for the first time, the sheer scale of the concrete bowl rising from the urban landscape takes your breath away. When you step inside and see 87,000 seats cascading downward toward the pitch, you understand why this place is a cathedral.</p>

        <p>For the traveling football fan, there is no stadium in Latin America more historically significant. If you care about the history of this sport, you need to stand inside the Azteca at least once in your life. This guide tells you everything you need to know to make that happen.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== HISTORY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="history">History: Two World Cups and the Hand of God</h2>

        <h3 id="origins">Origins and Construction (1960s)</h3>
        <p>The idea for the Azteca was born from necessity. Mexico was awarded the 1970 World Cup, and the country needed a stadium that could hold the final and showcase Mexican ambition to the world. Construction began in 1962 and took four years. Over 10,000 workers contributed to the build, moving roughly 100,000 cubic meters of volcanic rock to shape the terrain. The result was a 107,000-seat colossus that, at the time of its inauguration, was the largest football stadium in the Americas.</p>

        <p>The first match was played on May 29, 1966: America defeated Torino of Italy 2-1 in front of a sold-out crowd. From that day forward, the Azteca became the undisputed center of Mexican football.</p>

        <h3 id="world-cup-1970">World Cup 1970 -- Pele's Crowning Glory</h3>
        <p>The 1970 World Cup is widely considered the most beautiful tournament ever played, and the Azteca was its stage. Mexico's first World Cup was a showcase of attacking football in dazzling Technicolor -- it was the first tournament broadcast live on color television worldwide. The Azteca hosted the opening ceremony, several group matches, a semifinal, and the final itself.</p>

        <p>On June 21, 1970, Brazil faced Italy in the final. In front of 107,412 spectators, Pele's Brazil produced one of the greatest performances in football history. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho, and Carlos Alberto sealed a 4-1 victory that earned Brazil the Jules Rimet trophy permanently. Carlos Alberto's fourth goal -- a sweeping team move finished with a thunderous right-footed strike -- is still regarded as one of the finest goals ever scored. It happened right here, on this pitch, in this stadium.</p>

        <h3 id="world-cup-1986">World Cup 1986 -- Maradona's Tournament</h3>
        <p>Mexico stepped in to host the 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew, and the Azteca once again took center stage. But this time, the tournament belonged to one man: <strong>Diego Armando Maradona</strong>.</p>

        <p>On June 22, 1986, in the quarter-final between Argentina and England, Maradona produced what many consider the two most famous goals in football history -- both inside the Azteca. The first, the <strong>"Hand of God,"</strong> was a punch past goalkeeper Peter Shilton that the referee did not see. The second, just four minutes later, was the <strong>"Goal of the Century"</strong> -- a solo run from inside his own half, dribbling past five English players and the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. It was 60 meters of pure genius, and it happened on this pitch.</p>

        <p>Maradona would go on to lead Argentina to the final, held once again at the Azteca on June 29, 1986. Argentina defeated West Germany 3-2 in a pulsating match, and Maradona lifted the World Cup in the same stadium where he had produced the greatest individual display the sport has ever witnessed. The Azteca did not just host these moments -- it was part of them. The altitude, the roar, the heat, the history embedded in every concrete step. No other venue can claim ownership of both Pele's greatest day and Maradona's greatest day.</p>

            The Altitude Factor
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Estadio Azteca sits at 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level. This was a decisive tactical factor in both World Cups. Teams from lowland countries struggled with the thin air, while Mexico and South American sides accustomed to altitude thrived. Even today, visiting national teams arriving for World Cup qualifiers feel the effect within the first 20 minutes. As a fan, you will also notice it -- especially if you are climbing to the upper tiers.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="modern-era">The Modern Era</h3>
        <p>The Azteca has undergone several renovations since the 1980s. Its capacity was reduced from 107,000+ to the current 87,523 after the installation of individual seats replaced standing areas, in compliance with FIFA regulations. Major refurbishment projects in 1999 and again from 2016 to 2020 modernized facilities, improved accessibility, and added luxury suites and premium areas. The stadium hosted matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, returning it once again to the global stage.</p>

        <p>Throughout all the changes, the Azteca has remained the uncontested home of Club America since 1966 and the primary home of the Mexico national team. It has hosted Copa America matches, CONCACAF Gold Cup finals, NFL regular-season games, and concerts by the biggest artists in the world. But football is what defines it. Football is what fills it. Football is why you are reading this guide.</p>

        <h2 id="clubs">Who Plays Here: Club America & El Tri</h2>

        <h3>Club America</h3>
        <p><strong>Club America</strong> is the most successful club in Mexican football history, with 15 Liga MX titles and multiple international trophies. Known as <em>Las Aguilas</em> (The Eagles), America is also the most polarizing club in the country -- you either love them or you despise them. Their fanbase is enormous and fills the Azteca for every home match, especially for the big derbies.</p>

        <p>Regular Liga MX matches at the Azteca typically draw 40,000 to 60,000 fans. For the <strong>Clasico Nacional</strong> (America vs Chivas) or <strong>Clasico de Clasicos</strong> (America vs Cruz Azul), the stadium regularly sells out to its full 87,000+ capacity. The atmosphere during these derbies is ferocious -- drums, flags, choreographed tifos from the barra brava (La Monumental), and a wall of sound that never stops from kickoff to the final whistle.</p>

        <h3>El Tri (Mexico National Team)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Mexico national team</strong> uses Estadio Azteca as its primary home ground for World Cup qualifiers, CONCACAF Nations League matches, and major friendlies. Playing at the Azteca is considered a massive advantage for El Tri -- the combination of the altitude, the deafening crowd, and the hostile atmosphere makes it one of the toughest away fixtures in world football. The United States, for example, did not win a World Cup qualifier at the Azteca for decades.</p>

        <p>National team matches fill the Azteca with a different kind of energy compared to club football. The entire country unites behind El Tri, and the green sea of jerseys and the coordinated chants create an atmosphere that is almost ritualistic. If your visit coincides with a World Cup qualifier or a big international match, do not miss it.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There: Metro, Tren Ligero & Rideshare</h2>

        <p>One of the great advantages of Estadio Azteca is that it is well served by public transport, making it accessible even if you do not know Mexico City well. The stadium is located in the Coapa neighborhood in the south of the city, along Calzada de Tlalpan, one of the major north-south arteries.</p>

        <h3>Metro Line 2 + Tren Ligero (Recommended)</h3>
        <p>This is the classic route and the one most fans use. Take <strong>Metro Line 2</strong> (the blue line) to <strong>Tasquena</strong>, the southern terminus. At Tasquena, exit the metro and follow the signs to the <strong>Tren Ligero</strong> (light rail). Board the Tren Ligero heading south toward Xochimilco and get off at the <strong>Estadio Azteca</strong> station -- just one stop from the stadium entrance. The entire journey from central CDMX takes 40-60 minutes and costs under $10 MXN ($0.50 USD).</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Uber and DiDi</h3>
        <p>Ride-hailing apps work perfectly in CDMX and are a comfortable alternative, especially at night after the match. From Roma/Condesa, expect to pay $80-150 MXN ($5-9 USD) each way, depending on traffic and surge pricing. From the Historic Center, it will be slightly less. <strong>Important:</strong> After the match, there is always a surge and rides can be hard to book immediately. Walk a few blocks away from the stadium to improve your chances of getting matched with a driver, or wait 20-30 minutes for the surge to decrease.</p>

        <h3>Driving</h3>
        <p>If you have a rental car, the stadium has extensive parking lots along Calzada de Tlalpan. Parking costs between $100-200 MXN. However, be prepared for heavy traffic after the match -- exiting the parking area can take 30 minutes or more. Public transport is genuinely the better option.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">After the final whistle, the area around the Azteca becomes extremely congested. Do not expect to get into a taxi or Uber immediately. The Tren Ligero will be packed but it moves. If you are not in a rush, wait 15-20 minutes inside the stadium or at a nearby taco stand and let the first wave of fans pass. The commute becomes much easier after the initial exodus.</p>

        <h2 id="tickets">Tickets: Where to Buy and How Much</h2>

        <p>Getting tickets for Estadio Azteca depends entirely on the match. Regular Liga MX matches are relatively easy to get into. Derbies and national team qualifiers require more planning.</p>

        <h3>Official Channels</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Club America website</strong> (clubamerica.com.mx) -- the primary source for Liga MX home matches. You may need to create an account.</li>
          <li><strong>Ticketmaster Mexico</strong> (ticketmaster.com.mx) -- handles sales for many matches, especially high-profile ones and national team fixtures.</li>
          <li><strong>Superboletos</strong> -- used for some events and concerts at the Azteca.</li>
          <li><strong>Box office at the stadium</strong> -- open on matchday for remaining tickets, but risky for big matches as they may sell out online first.</li>

            Ticket Scam Warning
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Never buy tickets from street scalpers or social media resellers.</strong> Fake ticket scams are extremely common for high-demand matches at the Azteca, especially the Clasico Nacional. Only use official channels. If a deal looks too good to be true, it is. Counterfeit tickets are sophisticated and can pass a visual inspection -- they fail at the turnstile, and at that point your money is gone. Read our <a href="../guides/tickets-without-scams.html" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;">Tickets Without Scams guide</a> for more detail.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Tips for the Traveling Fan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For regular Liga MX matches:</strong> Tickets are usually available up to matchday. Buying online 2-3 days before is safest.</li>
          <li><strong>For derbies (Clasico Nacional, Clasico de Clasicos):</strong> Buy the moment tickets go on sale. Club America members get first access. If you do not have a membership, watch for the general sale and be ready to buy immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>For national team matches:</strong> World Cup qualifiers sell out. CONCACAF Nations League and friendlies are usually easier. Ticketmaster is the primary vendor for these.</li>
          <li><strong>Away section:</strong> If you are supporting the visiting team, you will be directed to the designated away section. These tickets are sometimes sold through the visiting club's channels rather than America's website.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== FOOD & DRINK ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food">Food & Drink: The Pre-Match Feast</h2>

        <p>The food scene around Estadio Azteca on matchday is not just a convenience -- it is one of the genuine highlights of the experience. The parking areas and surrounding streets transform into a massive open-air food market hours before kickoff. This is Mexico City at its most authentic: sizzling griddles, the smell of charcoal and adobo, the sound of vendors shouting their offerings, and thousands of fans eating and drinking together under the open sky.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat Outside the Stadium</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tacos al pastor:</strong> The undisputed king of Mexican street food. Adobo-marinated pork carved from a vertical spit, served on small corn tortillas with pineapple, cilantro, and onion. Look for the stands with the longest queues. $10-15 MXN per taco ($0.50-1 USD).</li>
          <li><strong>Quesadillas:</strong> Corn tortillas filled with cheese, huitlacoche (corn fungus -- trust us, it is delicious), flor de calabaza (squash blossom), or chicharron. $15-25 MXN each.</li>
          <li><strong>Tortas:</strong> Massive Mexican sandwiches on telera bread. The milanesa torta (breaded beef or chicken) is an engineering marvel. $30-50 MXN.</li>
          <li><strong>Esquites:</strong> Corn kernels served in a cup with mayonnaise, chili powder, lime juice, and cotija cheese. The ultimate matchday snack. $15-25 MXN.</li>
          <li><strong>Elotes:</strong> Grilled corn on the cob with the same toppings as esquites. Messy, delicious, essential. $15-20 MXN.</li>
          <li><strong>Tlacoyos:</strong> Thick corn masa patties stuffed with beans, requesón cheese, or chicharrón. Pre-Hispanic street food that has survived centuries for good reason. $10-20 MXN.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Drinks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Draft beer:</strong> Victoria, Modelo Especial, and Pacifico are the most common. $20-40 MXN ($1-2 USD) from street vendors. Absurdly cheap by international standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Michelada:</strong> Beer with lime juice, chili, Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes tomato juice, served in a salt-and-chili-rimmed glass. The quintessential Mexican beer cocktail. $40-60 MXN.</li>
          <li><strong>Agua fresca:</strong> Non-alcoholic fruit water (horchata, jamaica, tamarind). Refreshing and cheap at $10-20 MXN.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inside the Stadium</h3>
        <p>Concession stands inside the Azteca offer standard fare: hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, soft drinks, and beer ($60-90 MXN for a beer inside). The quality and variety are significantly lower than what you will find outside. Our strong recommendation: eat and drink before you enter. The pre-match food scene outside the Azteca is half the experience.</p>

            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at least 2 hours before kickoff to fully enjoy the pre-match food scene. Bring cash in small bills -- most street vendors do not accept cards. Budget $100-200 MXN ($6-12 USD) for a full pre-match meal with beer. That buys you 4-5 tacos, an esquite, and 2-3 beers. One of the best food-for-money ratios in world football.</p>

      <!-- ===== SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Guide</h2>

        <p>Estadio Azteca is generally safe for fans -- including visiting supporters and international tourists. Major police operations are deployed for every Liga MX match, and the security infrastructure around the stadium is well-established. That said, this is a massive venue in a megacity of 22 million, and common sense is your best defense.</p>

        <h3>General Safety Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive early, leave smart.</strong> Getting to the stadium 90-120 minutes before kickoff lets you pass through security without stress and enjoy the pre-match scene. After the match, avoid the immediate crush -- wait 15-20 minutes for the crowd to thin before heading to transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Uber or DiDi at night.</strong> While the Tren Ligero and Metro are safe during matchday operations, ride-hailing apps are the safer option after evening matches, especially if you are unfamiliar with the area.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep valuables hidden.</strong> Leave expensive watches, jewelry, and unnecessary electronics at your accommodation. Carry your phone in your front pocket. Wear your backpack on your chest in crowded areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash only, small bills.</strong> Bring what you need for the day and leave the rest locked up. $500-1,000 MXN in small bills is more than enough for food, drinks, and transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not buy from unofficial sellers.</strong> This applies to tickets, jerseys, and anything else. Inside the stadium perimeter, stick to official vendors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Visiting / Away Fans</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Away section access is independent.</strong> The police keep home and away fans separated with dedicated access routes. Follow the signage and police instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not wear your team's colors outside the away section.</strong> This is especially important during derbies (Clasico Nacional, Clasico de Clasicos). Inside your section, go wild. Outside, keep it neutral.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid confrontation.</strong> If someone tries to provoke you, walk away. Engaging with hostile fans in an unfamiliar city and stadium is never worth it.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel as a group.</strong> Especially when entering and leaving the stadium, there is safety in numbers. If you are a solo traveler, attach yourself to a group of fellow away fans.</li>
        </ul>

You <strong>cannot bring</strong> the following inside: backpacks or large bags, umbrellas, professional cameras with detachable lenses, glass bottles, cans, lighters, belts with metal buckles, selfie sticks, or any type of flag pole. Small clear bags and waist pouches are usually fine. Check the official Club America website for the latest list before your visit.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Visit on a weekday morning for the quietest experience and the best chance of a small-group tour. If you are in CDMX on a non-matchday, the museum is an excellent way to spend a morning before heading to Coyoacan for lunch -- Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul is just a few kilometers away.</p>

        <h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay for an Azteca Match</h2>

        <p>The Azteca is in the south of Mexico City. You do not need to stay in the immediate vicinity -- in fact, we recommend staying in one of the city's better-connected tourist neighborhoods and using transport to get to the match.</p>

        <p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> <strong>Coyoacan</strong> is the best base if the Azteca is your primary destination. It is the closest quality neighborhood, with a charming bohemian character, excellent markets, and the Tren Ligero connection right there. <strong>Roma/Condesa</strong> is the best all-rounder if you want to combine football with CDMX nightlife and dining.

                Estadio Azteca is the only football stadium in the world to have hosted two FIFA World Cup finals -- 1970 (Brazil 4-1 Italy) and 1986 (Argentina 3-2 West Germany). It is also where Diego Maradona scored both the "Hand of God" and the "Goal of the Century" against England in the 1986 quarter-final. With a capacity of approximately 87,000, it is one of the largest stadiums in the world and serves as the home ground for both Club America and the Mexico national team.

                The most common route is Metro Line 2 (blue line) to Tasquena station, then transfer to the Tren Ligero (light rail) heading south. Get off at the Estadio Azteca stop, which is right next to the stadium. The entire journey from central Mexico City costs under $0.50 USD and takes 40-60 minutes. On matchdays, extra services are usually added to handle the crowds. Uber and DiDi are also reliable alternatives.

                For regular Liga MX matches, tickets range from approximately $15 to $60 USD depending on the section. General admission (Sol General) starts around $250-350 MXN, mid-tier shaded sections (Sombra) run $500-700 MXN, and premium midfield seats (Preferente) cost $800-1,200 MXN.

                Yes, Estadio Azteca is generally safe for visiting fans. The stadium areas are heavily policed on matchday, with dedicated security operations for major matches. Away fans have their own designated section with independent access. Standard precautions apply: arrive early, do not flash valuables, use ride-hailing apps for transport at night, and avoid wearing the visiting team's colors outside the designated away section, especially during derbies.

                The area around the Azteca transforms into a massive open-air food market on matchdays. You will find tacos al pastor, quesadillas, tortas, esquites (corn in a cup), elotes (grilled corn), and tlacoyos from dozens of street vendors. Prices are very affordable -- a full pre-match meal with 4-5 tacos and a couple of beers costs around $100-200 MXN ($6-12 USD). Inside the stadium, standard concession stands sell hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, beer, and soft drinks. The street food outside is significantly better and cheaper.

                Estadio Azteca sits at 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level. If you are coming from a low-altitude city, you may feel shortness of breath when climbing stairs to the upper tiers, and alcohol will hit harder than usual. Drink plenty of water, take it easy on your first day in Mexico City, and avoid excessive alcohol before the match. Most visitors acclimatize within 24-48 hours. If possible, arrive at least a day before the match to adjust.
