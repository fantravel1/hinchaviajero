Millonarios and Santa Fe both sell tickets online through platforms like TuBoleta or directly at the El Campin ticket windows on matchday. For regular Liga BetPlay matches, availability is generally good and you can often buy tickets on the day of the match. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico Capitalino, tickets sell out faster and buying in advance is strongly recommended. Prices range from 10 to 30 USD depending on the section. Avoid buying from street resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets do circulate. Bring a valid ID or passport, as it is required for entry at most Colombian stadiums."

          "text": "Very likely, yes. Bogota sits at 2,640 meters (8,660 feet) above sea level, and altitude sickness (known locally as soroche) affects many visitors, especially those arriving from sea-level cities. Symptoms include headaches, shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. These symptoms are amplified when you are jumping, singing, and celebrating in a stadium. Arrive at least one day before the match to acclimatize. Drink plenty of water, avoid heavy alcohol consumption the night before, eat light meals, and consider drinking agua de panela (sugarcane water) or coca tea, which locals recommend for altitude adjustment. If symptoms are severe, pharmacies sell altitude sickness medication (Sorojchi Pills) over the counter."

El Campin is located in a central and well-connected area, and there is significant police presence on matchdays. Arrive early, stick to the main approaches to the stadium, and leave promptly after the final whistle. Avoid wearing rival team colors — do not wear Santa Fe gear near the Millonarios sections and vice versa. After the match, take a taxi or ride-hailing app (Uber, DiDi, InDrive) rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. Keep your phone and valuables out of sight, especially around the stadium exits where crowds are dense. The neighborhoods of Chapinero and Zona T near the stadium are well-lit and have bars open after the match."

Football is played year-round, so almost any month works. The best windows are February through May (Apertura) and July through November (Finalización), when the league is in full swing. Bogota does not have traditional seasons — the weather is consistently cool (12-20°C) year-round due to the altitude, with drier periods in December-February and June-August. Rainy spells in April-May and October-November can make matchdays wet, so pack a rain jacket. Copa Libertadores group-stage matches typically run from April to June."

A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 70 to 120 USD per day. The Colombian peso offers excellent value for visitors carrying dollars or euros. A full ajiaco soup at a traditional restaurant costs around 4-7 USD, and a corrientazo (set lunch) at a neighborhood spot is typically 2-4 USD."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY BOGOTA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-bogota">Why Bogota?</h2>

        <p>Bogota is the beating heart of Colombian football. The capital city is home to the two most decorated clubs in the country — Millonarios FC and Independiente Santa Fe — and their rivalry, the Clasico Capitalino, is one of the oldest and most passionate derbies in all of South America. Both clubs share the iconic Estadio Nemesio Camacho "El Campin," a ground that has witnessed over seven decades of glory, heartbreak, and ear-splitting noise from two fanbases that refuse to be outdone by the other.</p>

        <p>What makes Bogota unique among South American football cities is its altitude. At 2,640 meters above sea level, the city sits higher than any other major football capital on the continent. The thin air is not just a physiological reality — it is a tactical weapon. Visiting teams from sea-level cities arrive gasping by the 60th minute, while local sides are conditioned to thrive in the oxygen-deprived atmosphere. As a fan in the stands, you will feel it too: the breathlessness when you jump, the dizziness after singing at full volume for 90 minutes. It adds a raw, physical dimension to the experience that you simply cannot get at sea level.</p>

        <p>Beyond football, Bogota is a sprawling, complex, endlessly fascinating city. The colonial streets of La Candelaria, the nightlife of Zona T and Chapinero, the street art on every wall, the emerald dealers on Jimenez Avenue, the ajiaco steaming in clay pots at corner restaurants — it all creates a backdrop for your football trip that is rich, chaotic, and unforgettable. Colombian hospitality is legendary, and Bogotanos are proud to share their city and their clubs with visiting fans.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Bogota, football is not a weekend hobby. It is a Monday-to-Sunday conversation. You hear it in the taxi, in the office, at the family lunch table. Blue or red — Millonarios or Santa Fe — there is no neutral ground. You pick a side, and you carry it for life."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the traveling football fan, Bogota also offers outstanding value. Colombia remains one of the most affordable countries in South America for visitors carrying dollars or euros. Match tickets, street food, hostels, and transport are all remarkably cheap, and the quality of what you get for your money — especially the food — is world-class. A full matchday experience, from the pre-match empanadas to the post-match aguardiente, can be had for a fraction of what you would spend in Buenos Aires or Santiago.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="must-visit-stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Bogota has two football stadiums that host professional matches. One is a legendary arena at the center of Colombian football history; the other is a more modest venue with its own character. Both are worth experiencing.</p>

        <!-- El Campin -->
        <h3 id="el-campin">Estadio Nemesio Camacho "El Campin" — Millonarios FC &amp; Independiente Santa Fe</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~36,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Calle 57 with Carrera 30, Teusaquillo<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1938 (renovated multiple times, most recently for the 2011 U-20 World Cup)</p>

        <p>El Campin is Bogota's football cathedral and one of the most storied stadiums in Colombian football. Built in 1938 and named after a famous hacienda that once occupied the land, the stadium has been the shared home of Millonarios and Santa Fe for the better part of a century. That coexistence — two bitter rivals living under the same roof — gives El Campin a unique energy. On any given weekend, the stadium can be bathed in blue (Millonarios) or red (Santa Fe), and when the Clasico Capitalino rolls around, the ground literally splits in half.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere at El Campin on a big night is phenomenal. The "laterales" (side stands) are where the most fervent supporters sit — or rather, stand and jump for 90 minutes straight. The barras bravas of both clubs (Comandos Azules for Millonarios, La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur for Santa Fe) produce a non-stop wall of sound that reverberates through the concrete. The altitude amplifies the acoustic effect: sound carries differently in the thin air, and the chanting has a particular sharpness that you feel in your chest.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> El Campin is centrally located and well-connected. The TransMilenio station "Estadio" on the Carrera 30 corridor drops you right at the entrance. From Chapinero or Zona T, it is a 10-15 minute walk. Taxis and ride-hailing apps from most parts of the city cost 2-5 USD. On matchday, Carrera 30 gets congested, so arrive early if you are taking a taxi.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at least 90 minutes before kickoff. The pre-match atmosphere around El Campin is half the experience — street vendors selling empanadas, fans painting their faces, drummers warming up, and the smell of grilled meat mixing with the cool mountain air. The area along Carrera 30 between the stadium and the Parque Simon Bolivar is the best stretch for soaking it in.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Estadio de Techo -->
        <h3 id="estadio-de-techo">Estadio Metropolitano de Techo — La Equidad</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~10,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Kennedy, southwestern Bogota<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1981</p>

        <p>The Estadio de Techo is the home ground of La Equidad Seguros, Bogota's third professional football club. La Equidad is a unique case in Colombian football: originally founded as the company team of an insurance cooperative (hence the name "Equidad Seguros"), they have quietly built a competitive first-division side with minimal fanbase compared to Millonarios and Santa Fe. Attending a match at Techo is a completely different experience from El Campin — intimate, low-key, almost surreal in its quietness on some nights.</p>

        <p>The stadium itself is modest and utilitarian, located in the working-class neighborhood of Kennedy. It does not have the history or the grandeur of El Campin, but it offers something that bigger grounds cannot: proximity. You are right on top of the pitch. You can hear the players talk. On a cold Bogota night with the Andes in the background, there is a particular charm to watching Liga BetPlay football in a near-empty stadium surrounded by a handful of dedicated Equidad fans who show up rain or shine.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> TransMilenio to the Americas corridor, then transfer to a feeder route toward Kennedy. It is less centrally located than El Campin, so budget 40-60 minutes from the city center by public transport. A taxi or Uber from Chapinero takes about 30-40 minutes depending on traffic.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: DERBIES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Bogota's derby scene revolves around one central rivalry that defines the city's football identity, plus a handful of regional matchups that bring visiting fanbases into the capital.</p>

        <!-- Clasico Capitalino -->
        <h3 id="clasico-capitalino">Millonarios FC vs Independiente Santa Fe — The Clasico Capitalino</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 82/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Clasico Capitalino is the oldest and most important derby in Colombian football. Millonarios and Santa Fe have been fighting for supremacy over Bogota since the late 1940s, and the rivalry runs deep — through families, friendships, workplaces, and neighborhoods. Millonarios, founded in 1946, became the dominant force in the early years of professional Colombian football, assembling the legendary "Ballet Azul" (Blue Ballet) team of the 1950s that featured Argentine stars like Alfredo Di Stefano. Santa Fe, the older of the two (founded in 1941), carries the pride of being Colombia's first professional football club.</p>

        <p>The dynamic is intense. Millonarios fans — known as the "Embajadores" (Ambassadors) — consider themselves the biggest club in Bogota and in Colombia by historical weight. Their barra brava, Comandos Azules, is one of the largest and most organized in the country. Santa Fe fans — the "Cardenales" (Cardinals) — are fiercely loyal and see themselves as the soul of the city, the true people's club. Their barra, La Guardia Albi-Roja Sur, matches Comandos Azules in volume and passion.</p>

        <p>When the Clasico Capitalino happens at El Campin, the stadium splits roughly in half: one end blue, one end red. The noise is extraordinary. Both barras try to out-sing each other for the entire 90 minutes, and the visual spectacle — blue smoke bombs on one side, red on the other — is genuinely breathtaking. The match itself is always combative, with tackles flying and referees under enormous pressure.</p>

            Important note about the Clasico
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">During the Clasico Capitalino, do not wear the wrong colors in the wrong section. The sections are strictly divided and tension between the fanbases is real. If you are a neutral, pick one side and commit to it for the night — buy a ticket in that team's section and behave accordingly. After the match, leave immediately and take a taxi or ride-hailing app. The streets around El Campin can be chaotic when 36,000 people pour out at the same time.</p>

        <h3 id="other-matchups">Other Notable Matchups in Bogota</h3>

        <p>While the Clasico Capitalino is the main event, Bogota hosts other compelling fixtures throughout the Liga BetPlay season:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Millonarios vs Atletico Nacional:</strong> When Nacional (from Medellin, Colombia's other football powerhouse) visits El Campin, it is always a blockbuster. Nacional has the largest traveling fanbase in Colombian football, and their presence in the away section creates a genuine home-vs-away atmosphere that most domestic league matches lack.</li>
          <li><strong>Santa Fe vs America de Cali:</strong> Two historic clubs with large national fanbases. When America travels to Bogota, the red-on-red matchup generates a passionate atmosphere and a high-stakes encounter between two of the biggest clubs outside Medellin.</li>
          <li><strong>La Equidad vs anyone:</strong> If you want the opposite of the intensity described above — a quiet, low-pressure, "pure football" experience — attend a La Equidad home match at Techo. It is a unique window into the economics of Colombian football: a club that survives and competes without a mass fanbase.</li>
          <li><strong>Copa Libertadores nights at El Campin:</strong> When Millonarios or Santa Fe play in the Libertadores, El Campin transforms. The continental competition brings an extra level of intensity, and Colombian clubs playing at altitude have a genuine home advantage that visiting teams from Brazil or Argentina visibly struggle with.</li>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Choosing your base in Bogota is critical. The city is enormous, traffic is a nightmare during rush hours, and the neighborhoods vary dramatically in character, safety, and proximity to El Campin. These are your best options as a football-focused visitor.</p>

        <h3>Chapinero</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The ideal base for football fans. Chapinero sits just east of El Campin, within walking distance of the stadium on matchday. It is one of Bogota's most vibrant and cosmopolitan neighborhoods, with excellent restaurants, craft beer bars, bookshops, and a lively nightlife scene. Chapinero Alto (the upper part, closer to the mountains) has a more bohemian, artsy feel. The neighborhood is well-connected by TransMilenio and has a wide range of hostels and hotels. Safety is generally good on the main streets, though the usual precautions apply after dark in quieter side streets.</p>

        <h3>La Candelaria</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The backpacker and history lover. La Candelaria is Bogota's colonial historic center — cobblestone streets, colorful colonial houses, street art on every wall, the Gold Museum, Plaza Bolivar, and dozens of cheap hostels catering to international travelers. It is the most atmospheric neighborhood in the city, but it is farther from El Campin (30-40 minutes by TransMilenio or taxi). Safety is a concern after dark — stick to main streets and avoid walking alone at night. During the day, it is magical.</p>

        <h3>Zona T / Zona Rosa</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who want comfort and nightlife. Zona T is Bogota's upscale entertainment district, centered around the T-shaped pedestrian street at Calle 82 and Carrera 13. Restaurants, bars, clubs, and shopping malls are all concentrated here. It is well-lit, heavily policed, and feels safe even late at night. El Campin is about 20-25 minutes south by taxi. More expensive than Chapinero or La Candelaria, but the convenience and safety are worth it for shorter visits.</p>

        <h3>Usaquen</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families and those who prioritize safety above all. Usaquen is a former colonial village that has been absorbed into northern Bogota, retaining its village-square charm while being surrounded by modern high-rises. The Sunday flea market on the main square is excellent. Great restaurants, safe streets, and a relaxed atmosphere. The downside is distance: Usaquen is far north, and getting to El Campin on matchday takes 30-45 minutes by taxi or TransMilenio, longer in traffic.</p>

            Areas to avoid
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Exercise caution in southern Bogota, particularly at night.</strong> Areas like Ciudad Bolivar, Bosa, and parts of Kennedy have safety issues and are not recommended for tourists. The area around the Estadio de Techo (Kennedy) is generally okay on matchday with police presence, but take a taxi or ride-hailing app directly to and from the stadium rather than walking the neighborhood. In La Candelaria, avoid venturing east of Carrera 3 (toward the mountains) after dark.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Bogota is a massive city — over 8 million people in a sprawling urban area — and traffic is infamously bad. Getting around efficiently requires understanding the transport options and planning ahead, especially on matchday. One factor affects everything: the altitude. At 2,640 meters, even walking uphill to a TransMilenio station can leave you winded if you have just arrived from sea level.</p>

        <h3>TransMilenio</h3>
        <p>Bogota's bus rapid transit system is the backbone of public transport. It operates on dedicated lanes along the major avenues (Carrera 30, Calle 80, Carrera 10, Autopista Norte, NQS, and others) with enclosed stations. It is cheap (under 1 USD per ride), extensive, and — during off-peak hours — reasonably fast. On matchday, the "Estadio" station on the Carrera 30 corridor is your best bet for getting to El Campin. However, TransMilenio is notoriously overcrowded during rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM). Avoid it at those times if you can, and be extra vigilant about pickpockets in crowded stations and buses.</p>

        <h3>SITP (Integrated Public Transport System)</h3>
        <p>The SITP is the network of blue feeder buses that complement TransMilenio, covering routes that the BRT does not reach. They are slower but useful for getting to specific neighborhoods. You pay with a rechargeable TuLlave card (the same card works on TransMilenio). Buy one at any TransMilenio station or authorized kiosk. The SITP buses are how you would get to the Estadio de Techo if you are watching La Equidad.</p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>Taxis in Bogota are yellow, metered, and relatively cheap. A ride across the city rarely exceeds 8-10 USD. However, there have been historical issues with unregistered taxis and occasional scams (rigged meters, long routes). For safety, use official taxi apps like Tappsi, or hail cabs from designated stands. On matchday, taxis are the fastest way to get to the stadium if you are not near a TransMilenio line, but be aware that traffic around El Campin grinds to a halt in the final 30 minutes before kickoff.</p>

        <h3>Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
        <p>Uber, DiDi, and InDrive all operate in Bogota. Uber exists in a legal gray zone (similar to Buenos Aires) but functions normally and is widely used. InDrive lets you negotiate the fare with the driver, which can be useful. These apps are your best option for getting home after the match — request your ride as the final whistle approaches, and walk a few blocks away from the stadium to a less congested pickup point.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport (El Dorado — BOG)</h3>
        <p>Bogota's international airport, El Dorado, is located west of the city center. It is the busiest airport in Colombia and one of the busiest in South America. Options for getting to the city: official airport taxis (fixed fare, approximately 8-15 USD to the city center — buy the ticket at the taxi counter inside the terminal), TransMilenio (take the feeder bus from the airport to the Portal El Dorado station, then connect to the system — very cheap but slow and complicated with luggage), or ride-hailing apps (5-12 USD depending on destination and traffic). The drive to Chapinero or Zona T takes 30-60 minutes depending on traffic.</p>

            Altitude and transport
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Do not underestimate the altitude when planning transport. Walking 15 minutes to El Campin from Chapinero seems easy — until you are doing it uphill at 2,640m after arriving from sea level that morning. Give yourself extra time for everything. Climb stairs slowly. Do not rush to catch a TransMilenio bus. Your body needs 24-48 hours to start adjusting. On your first day, take taxis.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-and-previa">Food &amp; The Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>Colombian food culture is rich, hearty, and perfectly suited to a football trip. Bogota in particular has a food scene that ranges from dirt-cheap street stalls to world-class restaurants, and the pre-match ritual around El Campin is its own gastronomic experience.</p>

        <h3>The Pre-Match at El Campin</h3>
        <p>On matchday, the streets surrounding El Campin transform. Starting about two to three hours before kickoff, the sidewalks along Carrera 30 and the blocks east of the stadium fill with vendors selling empanadas, arepas, grilled corn, mango with lime and salt, and every possible variation of fried street food. The smell of chorizo on makeshift grills mixes with the sound of drums and chanting as fans begin to gather. Beer vendors (Poker is the go-to) and aguardiente sellers work the crowds. The atmosphere builds slowly, and by the time you enter the stadium, you have already lived half the experience.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ajiaco:</strong> Bogota's signature dish. A thick, hearty soup made with three varieties of potato, chicken, corn on the cob, capers, cream, and avocado. It is the ultimate warming meal in Bogota's cool climate and perfect fuel before a night match. A bowl costs 4-7 USD at a traditional restaurant.</li>
          <li><strong>Bandeja Paisa:</strong> Originally from the Antioquia region (Medellin), but available everywhere in Bogota. A massive platter of red beans, rice, ground meat, chicharron (fried pork belly), fried egg, plantain, arepa, and avocado. Not for the faint of stomach. Costs 4-8 USD at a neighborhood restaurant.</li>
          <li><strong>Empanadas:</strong> The quintessential Colombian street food. Deep-fried corn pockets filled with seasoned potato and meat, served with aji (spicy salsa). Sold on every street corner near El Campin for less than 1 USD each. Buy two or three and eat them standing up like a local.</li>
          <li><strong>Arepas:</strong> Flat corn cakes that can be stuffed with cheese, eggs, chicken, or just eaten plain with butter. Arepas de choclo (sweet corn arepas with cheese) are a Bogota specialty.</li>
          <li><strong>Tamales:</strong> The bogotano tamal is a large banana-leaf wrapped package of corn dough stuffed with chicken, pork, vegetables, and spices. A common breakfast or pre-match snack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Drink</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Poker beer:</strong> The most popular beer in Bogota and the default pre-match drink. Light, cheap, and everywhere. A bottle at a street stall costs less than 1 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Aguardiente:</strong> Colombia's national spirit. An anise-flavored sugarcane liquor that is drunk in shots, usually shared among friends from a communal bottle. Aguardiente Nectar and Aguardiente Antioqueno are the most common brands. It burns on the way down and warms you up in the cold Bogota night air. Essential to the pre-match ritual.</li>
          <li><strong>Agua de panela:</strong> Warm sugarcane water, often with lime. Non-alcoholic, cheap, and widely believed to help with altitude adjustment. Sold at street stalls everywhere. Drink it on your first day.</li>
          <li><strong>Tinto:</strong> Colombian black coffee, served sweet and small. Available on literally every street corner for a few cents. The fuel of daily life in Bogota.</li>
        </ul>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Go easy on the aguardiente before the match, especially if you have not acclimatized to the altitude. Alcohol hits harder at 2,640m, and dehydration from drinking will make altitude symptoms worse. Hydrate with water and agua de panela between beers. Save the serious aguardiente session for after the final whistle.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Bogota has improved dramatically in terms of safety over the past two decades, and most tourists have trouble-free visits. However, it is still a large Latin American city with the standard risks, and the football context adds some specific considerations.</p>

        <h3>Altitude Safety</h3>
        <p>This is the number one health risk for visiting football fans in Bogota, and most people underestimate it. At 2,640 meters, the air has approximately 25% less oxygen than at sea level. This affects everyone, though the severity varies.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive at least 24 hours before the match.</strong> Ideally 48 hours. Do not fly in from Cartagena or Santa Marta (sea level) and go straight to the stadium — you will feel terrible.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrate aggressively.</strong> Drink 3-4 liters of water per day. Dehydration makes altitude sickness worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid heavy alcohol on day one.</strong> Alcohol amplifies altitude symptoms. A couple of beers is fine; a binge session is not.</li>
          <li><strong>Eat light.</strong> Heavy meals (like bandeja paisa) on your first day can make you feel sluggish and nauseous combined with altitude.</li>
          <li><strong>Coca tea and agua de panela.</strong> Both are widely available and locals swear by them for altitude adjustment. No harm in trying.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorojchi Pills.</strong> Available over the counter at any pharmacy. They contain aspirin, caffeine, and salofene, and are specifically designed for altitude sickness. Take one before the match if you are feeling rough.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear team colors on public transport.</strong> Keep your jersey in your bag until you are at the stadium. This applies especially to Millonarios or Santa Fe jerseys on Clasico day.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your phone in your front pocket.</strong> Phone theft is the most common crime in Bogota. Avoid taking it out on the street while walking, especially near TransMilenio stations and in crowded areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps at night.</strong> After the match, take an Uber, DiDi, or taxi rather than walking through unfamiliar streets.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid "papaya."</strong> Colombians have an expression: "no dar papaya" — do not make yourself an easy target. Do not flash expensive watches, cameras, or large amounts of cash. Keep valuables out of sight.</li>
          <li><strong>La Candelaria: day is fine, night requires caution.</strong> The historic center is safe during the day with normal tourist activity. At night, the streets empty and security risks increase. Stick to main streets and take taxis after dark.</li>
          <li><strong>Southern neighborhoods: exercise extra caution.</strong> Areas like Ciudad Bolivar, Bosa, and parts of Kennedy are not recommended for tourists, especially at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Scopolamine awareness.</strong> This is a drug used in rare but reported cases to incapacitate victims. Never accept drinks, food, or cigarettes from strangers. This applies to bars and clubs as much as to the street.</li>
        </ul>

          <p class="info-box__text">Colombian barras bravas (organized fan groups) can be territorial and aggressive. As a foreign visitor, you are generally not a target, but avoid interacting with the barras directly, do not photograph them without permission, and do not enter their designated sections of the stadium unless you are invited. Stick to the general admission sections, enjoy the atmosphere from a safe distance, and you will have an incredible time.</p>

                The easiest way is through the official websites or box offices of each club. Millonarios and Santa Fe both sell tickets online through platforms like TuBoleta or directly at the El Campin ticket windows on matchday. For regular Liga BetPlay matches, availability is generally good and you can often buy tickets on the day of the match. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico Capitalino, tickets sell out faster and buying in advance is strongly recommended. Prices range from 10 to 30 USD depending on the section. Avoid buying from street resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets do circulate. Bring a valid ID or passport, as it is required for entry at most Colombian stadiums.

                Very likely, yes. Bogota sits at 2,640 meters (8,660 feet) above sea level, and altitude sickness (known locally as soroche) affects many visitors, especially those arriving from sea-level cities. Symptoms include headaches, shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. These symptoms are amplified when you are jumping, singing, and celebrating in a stadium. Arrive at least one day before the match to acclimatize. Drink plenty of water, avoid heavy alcohol consumption the night before, eat light meals, and consider drinking agua de panela (sugarcane water) or coca tea, which locals recommend for altitude adjustment. If symptoms are severe, pharmacies sell altitude sickness medication (Sorojchi Pills) over the counter.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                Yes, attending a match in Bogota is generally safe if you follow standard precautions. El Campin is located in a central and well-connected area, and there is significant police presence on matchdays. Arrive early, stick to the main approaches to the stadium, and leave promptly after the final whistle. Avoid wearing rival team colors — do not wear Santa Fe gear near the Millonarios sections and vice versa. After the match, take a taxi or ride-hailing app (Uber, DiDi, InDrive) rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. Keep your phone and valuables out of sight, especially around the stadium exits where crowds are dense. The neighborhoods of Chapinero and Zona T near the stadium are well-lit and have bars open after the match.

                The Liga BetPlay season in Colombia runs in two halves (Apertura and Finalizacion), typically from late January through December with a short mid-year break. Football is played year-round, so almost any month works. The best windows are February through May (Apertura) and July through November (Finalizacion), when the league is in full swing. Bogota does not have traditional seasons — the weather is consistently cool (12-20 degrees Celsius) year-round due to the altitude, with drier periods in December-February and June-August. Rainy spells in April-May and October-November can make matchdays wet, so pack a rain jacket. Copa Libertadores group-stage matches typically run from April to June.

                Bogota is one of the most affordable football destinations in South America. A backpacker can manage on 30 to 50 USD per day, including hostel accommodation (8-18 USD per night in La Candelaria or Chapinero), match tickets (10-30 USD), street food and local restaurants (3-8 USD per meal), and TransMilenio public transport (under 1 USD per ride). A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 70 to 120 USD per day. The Colombian peso offers excellent value for visitors carrying dollars or euros. A full ajiaco soup at a traditional restaurant costs around 4-7 USD, and a corrientazo (set lunch) at a neighborhood spot is typically 2-4 USD.
