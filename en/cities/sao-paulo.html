Corinthians, Palmeiras, and São Paulo FC all sell tickets online — most require creating an account and some require a CPF (Brazilian tax ID number). For tourists without a CPF, authorized resellers and sports tourism agencies are the most reliable option. Some clubs offer ticket windows at the stadium on matchday for lower-demand fixtures. Never buy from street resellers (cambistas) or on social media — scams and counterfeit tickets are common. Prices range from 15 to 60 USD depending on the match and section."

Stick to well-lit main streets, use ride-hailing apps (99 or Uber) at night, keep your phone in your front pocket, and avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics. The metro system is safe and efficient. Neighborhoods like Paulista, Pinheiros, and Vila Madalena are well-policed and tourist-friendly.

As a foreign tourist, you can apply for a CPF at a Receita Federal office in Brazil or at a Brazilian consulate in your home country before traveling. Some clubs accept passport numbers instead. Alternatively, sports tourism agencies can purchase tickets on your behalf without you needing a CPF. Check each club's specific policy before matchday."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY SÃO PAULO ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Why São Paulo?</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is the largest city in South America. With over 22 million people in its metropolitan area, it is a sprawling, vertical, relentless megacity that never stops moving. And its football reflects exactly that energy: massive, intense, unavoidable. No city in the Americas has more professional football clubs than São Paulo. Not Buenos Aires, not Mexico City, not Rio de Janeiro. São Paulo stands alone at the top.</p>

        <p>Four of Brazil's most storied clubs call this city home: Corinthians, Palmeiras, São Paulo FC, and Santos. Between them, they hold multiple Copa Libertadores titles, dozens of Brasileirao championships, and a combined fanbase that numbers in the tens of millions. On any given weekend during the Brasileirao or the Campeonato Paulista, you can find world-class football being played across the city's stadiums, each with its own atmosphere, its own rituals, its own identity.</p>

        <p>What makes São Paulo special for the traveling fan is not just the quality of football on display. It is the infrastructure. Every major stadium in São Paulo is reachable by metro. The city has a vast network of hostels, hotels, and Airbnbs for every budget. The food scene is legendary — São Paulo is the gastronomic capital of Brazil, with everything from Michelin-starred restaurants to street-corner pastel stands that will change your life for a few reais. And the pre-match culture, the <em>previa</em>, is a ritual of beer, chanting, and grilled meat that rivals anything in Argentina.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"São Paulo does not seduce you with beaches or postcard views. It seizes you by the collar and drags you into its rhythm. And nowhere is that rhythm more powerful than inside a packed stadium on a Wednesday night under the floodlights."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the foreign visitor, São Paulo also offers something Buenos Aires and other South American football capitals cannot match: sheer variety. You can watch Corinthians play in a 49,000-seat arena built for the World Cup, then cross the city to see Palmeiras in a state-of-the-art modern arena, then head to the historic Morumbi to feel the weight of São Paulo FC's tradition, and finish the trip at the intimate Vila Belmiro in Santos where Pele built his legend. All within the same metropolitan area. All reachable by public transport.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>São Paulo's four major stadiums span the full spectrum of Brazilian football experience — from a World Cup-ready modern coliseum to the intimate ground where the greatest player in history made his name. Each one deserves a visit.</p>

        <!-- Neo Quimica Arena -->
        <h3 id="neo-quimica-arena">Neo Quimica Arena — Corinthians</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~49,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Itaquera, Av. Miguel Ignacio Curi 111<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 2014 (built for the FIFA World Cup)</p>

        <p>The Arena Corinthians — officially named Neo Quimica Arena for sponsorship — is the crown jewel of the Corinthians nation, the <em>Fiel</em> (the Faithful). Built for the opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, this stadium was the culmination of decades of Corinthians fans dreaming of a permanent home. The east-zone location in Itaquera, a working-class neighborhood far from the glamorous center, is entirely deliberate: this is where the Corinthians fanbase lives, breathes, and works. The stadium belongs to the people.</p>

        <p>The atmosphere here on a big night is ferocious. Corinthians boasts the largest organized fanbase in Brazil — the <em>Gavioes da Fiel</em> (Hawks of the Faithful) — and when 49,000 of them sing in unison, the sound is a wall that hits you in the chest. The eastern stand, where the organized torcida concentrates, never stops moving.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Metro Line 3-Red to Corinthians-Itaquera station. The station literally exits onto the stadium esplanade. It is the most metro-accessible stadium in South America. From Paulista Avenue, the ride takes about 40 minutes. Allow extra time on matchday — the trains get packed.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at Corinthians-Itaquera station at least 90 minutes before kickoff. The walk from the station to the stadium gates passes through a massive fan zone with food stalls, merchandise vendors, and chanting groups. This is part of the experience. Do not rush it.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Allianz Parque -->
        <h3 id="allianz-parque">Allianz Parque — Palmeiras</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~43,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Perdizes / Barra Funda, Rua Palestra Italia 200<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 2014</p>

        <p>Allianz Parque is arguably the finest football venue in Brazil. Built on the site of the old Palestra Italia (Palmeiras' historic home since 1933), this modern multi-purpose arena combines world-class facilities with an atmosphere that is pure Brazilian fury. The retractable roof, the steep stands that bring fans close to the pitch, and the acoustics that trap sound inside the bowl create an environment that opposing teams genuinely fear.</p>

        <p>Palmeiras — <em>Verdao</em> (the Big Green) — is the most successful club in Brazil by domestic titles. Their fans, the <em>Mancha Alviverde</em> and other organized groups, pack Allianz Parque with a relentless wall of noise. On Copa Libertadores nights, when the green flares are lit and the chants echo off the roof, this stadium is one of the hardest places to play football on the entire continent.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Metro Line 3-Red or CPTM Line 7-Ruby to Palmeiras-Barra Funda station. From there it is a 10-minute walk through a commercial area to the stadium. Alternatively, from Paulista Avenue the journey is about 20 minutes by metro. The area around the stadium has plenty of bars and restaurants for pre-match gathering.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10.29 3.86L1.82 18a2 2 0 0 0 1.71 3h16.94a2 2 0 0 0 1.71-3L13.71 3.86a2 2 0 0 0-3.42 0z"/><line x1="12" y1="9" x2="12" y2="13"/><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12.01" y2="17"/></svg>
            Derby day warning
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">On derby days (especially Palmeiras vs Corinthians), police control around Allianz Parque is extremely heavy. Streets are closed, fan groups are separated, and the atmosphere is tense. Follow police directions, do not wear rival colors anywhere near the stadium, and plan your exit route in advance. After the match, stay inside the stadium until the police give the all-clear to leave.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Morumbi -->
        <h3 id="morumbi">Estadio do Morumbi — São Paulo FC</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~66,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Morumbi, Praca Roberto Gomes Pedrosa 1<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1960</p>

        <p>The Morumbi is a colossus. For decades it was the largest privately-owned stadium in the world, and even today its sheer scale is imposing. Three open-air tiers rise steeply around the pitch, giving the stadium its distinctive silhouette that is recognizable from anywhere in the southern zone of the city. São Paulo FC — the <em>Tricolor Paulista</em> — has called this ground home since 1960, and it has hosted everything from Copa Libertadores finals to international friendlies and concerts.</p>

        <p>The Morumbi does not have the modern polish of Allianz Parque or the World Cup pedigree of Neo Quimica Arena. What it has is weight. This stadium carries decades of history in its concrete. When São Paulo FC play under the floodlights and the <em>Independente</em> torcida fills the northern stand with drums, flags, and non-stop chanting, the Morumbi becomes a cathedral of sound. It is raw, it is massive, and it is unmistakably Brazilian.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Metro Line 9-Emerald to Morumbi station, then a 15-minute walk or a short bus ride. Alternatively, Line 4-Yellow to Butanta and then bus 775P. Ride-hailing apps are also a good option — from Paulista Avenue the drive is about 25-35 minutes depending on traffic. São Paulo traffic can be brutal, so metro is the safest bet for timing.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">São Paulo FC is building a new stadium (the MorumBIS project involves a major renovation). Check the club's official channels before your trip to confirm the current match venue, as some fixtures may be relocated during construction phases. The museum and stadium tours are also worth visiting on non-matchdays.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Vila Belmiro -->
        <h3 id="vila-belmiro">Vila Belmiro — Santos FC</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~16,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Santos (coastal city, 70 km from São Paulo center), Rua Princesa Isabel 77<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1916</p>

        <p>Vila Belmiro is a pilgrimage. This is the stadium where Pele played over 1,000 matches. Where he scored most of his 1,283 career goals. Where he danced past defenders and made the beautiful game truly beautiful. The stadium is small — just 16,000 seats — and that is precisely its magic. There is no distance between you and the pitch. You can hear the players breathe, see the sweat on their faces, feel the ball hit the net. It is the most intimate major-club football experience in Brazil.</p>

        <p>Santos FC has fallen on harder times in recent years — relegation, financial troubles, rebuilding — but the Vila Belmiro remains sacred ground. The fans of <em>Peixe</em> (the Fish) are loyal and vocal, and the small stadium means the atmosphere is concentrated and intense even when not sold out. For any football fan with a sense of history, Vila Belmiro is non-negotiable.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> From São Paulo, take a bus from the Jabaquara bus terminal (next to Jabaquara metro station, Line 1-Blue) to Santos. The journey takes about 60-90 minutes depending on traffic. Once in Santos, the stadium is accessible by local bus or a short taxi ride from the city center. Alternatively, you can drive — the Anchieta-Imigrantes highway connects São Paulo to Santos directly.</p>

        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is a city divided by football loyalties. Four massive clubs sharing one metropolitan area means rivalries are everywhere — at work, at school, in every family, at every bar. These are the derbies that define the city.</p>

        <!-- Derby Paulista -->
        <h3 id="derby-paulista">Corinthians vs Palmeiras — Derby Paulista</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 90/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Derby Paulista is the biggest club rivalry in Brazilian football. Corinthians, the club of the working class, the masses, the <em>povo</em>, against Palmeiras, historically associated with the Italian immigrant community and now one of the wealthiest and most successful clubs in the country. The hatred runs deep and spans generations. This is not a friendly rivalry — families have been split, friendships ended, and workplaces turned into cold-war zones over this fixture.</p>

        <p>The match itself is a war of attrition. Both clubs bring organized fan groups that are among the largest and loudest in South America. The <em>Gavioes da Fiel</em> (Corinthians) and <em>Mancha Alviverde</em> (Palmeiras) create atmospheres that are genuinely intimidating. Violence has marred this fixture historically, and security on derby day is among the heaviest in South American football. The police deploy thousands of officers, fan groups are given separate access routes, and the surrounding streets are locked down hours before kickoff.</p>

            Critical safety note
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Derby Paulista is not a match for casual tourists wandering in without preparation. If you attend, get your tickets through official channels or a trusted agency, arrive early, follow all police instructions, stay in your assigned section, and do not leave the stadium until instructed. Under no circumstances wear the rival team's colors anywhere near the stadium vicinity. After the match, return to your accommodation by ride-hailing app or wait for organized metro departures.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Choque-Rei -->
        <h3 id="choque-rei">São Paulo FC vs Palmeiras — Choque-Rei</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 82/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Choque-Rei (Clash of Kings) pits São Paulo FC against Palmeiras in a rivalry built on mutual disdain and contrasting identities. São Paulo FC see themselves as the aristocratic club of the city — three Libertadores titles, three Club World Cups, a record of international success that Palmeiras could not match for decades. Palmeiras, in turn, dismiss São Paulo FC as pretentious and point to their own domestic dominance and recent continental resurgence. The needle between these two clubs is sharp and constant.</p>

        <p>What makes the Choque-Rei special is that it tends to produce spectacular football. Both clubs historically play attacking, technical football, and the matches often deliver drama and goals. The atmosphere in the stadiums is intense but slightly less volatile than the Derby Paulista, making it a more accessible option for the first-time visiting fan.</p>

        <!-- Majestoso -->
        <h3 id="majestoso">Corinthians vs São Paulo FC — Majestoso</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 80/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Majestoso (the Majestic) is the other great São Paulo derby, and it carries its own weight of history and bitterness. Corinthians fans see São Paulo FC as elitist and out of touch with the real city. São Paulo FC fans see Corinthians as crude and lacking in trophies (at least until Corinthians' 2012 Libertadores and Club World Cup wins changed that narrative). The class tension is real and mirrors the social divide that runs through São Paulo as a city.</p>

        <p>The Majestoso is played with enormous intensity. When hosted at Neo Quimica Arena with 49,000 Corinthians fans creating an avalanche of noise, it is one of the most hostile environments in Brazilian football. When São Paulo FC host at the Morumbi, the open-air tiers and the sheer size of the ground create a different kind of pressure — vast, echoing, inescapable.</p>

        <h3 id="other-derbies">Other São Paulo Derbies and Fixtures</h3>

        <p>The big three clubs are not the only football in São Paulo. The metropolitan area is home to a constellation of clubs competing across multiple divisions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Santos vs Corinthians:</strong> The <em>Classico Alvinegro</em> between two of Brazil's most decorated clubs. Santos bring their coastal intensity to the capital.</li>
          <li><strong>Palmeiras vs Santos:</strong> The <em>Classico da Saudade</em> (Derby of Nostalgia) — two clubs with deep historical roots and passionate fanbases.</li>
          <li><strong>Portuguesa vs Juventus:</strong> The <em>Classico da Moca</em>, a neighborhood rivalry rooted in the Italian and Portuguese immigrant communities. Lower division, but authentic to the bone.</li>
          <li><strong>São Paulo state clubs:</strong> The Campeonato Paulista features clubs from across the state — Guarani, Ponte Preta, Red Bull Bragantino, Inter de Limeira — all of whom visit São Paulo regularly. These matches offer a more relaxed, accessible entry point to Brazilian football.</li>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is enormous — one of the biggest urban sprawls on Earth. Where you base yourself matters enormously, both for matchday logistics and for your overall experience. These are the best neighborhoods for the traveling football fan.</p>

        <h3>Paulista Avenue (Bela Vista / Consolacao)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The first-time visitor who wants to be at the geographic and cultural heart of the city. Avenida Paulista is São Paulo's main artery — a straight boulevard lined with museums, shops, restaurants, and bars. It has direct metro access (Line 2-Green, Consolacao station) and is well connected to all the major stadiums. On Sundays, the avenue is closed to cars and becomes a pedestrian paradise. The surrounding streets of Bela Vista and Consolacao have excellent hostels and mid-range hotels. This is your default base if you are unsure where to stay.</p>

        <h3>Vila Madalena</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The fan who wants nightlife and pre-match bar culture. Vila Madalena is São Paulo's bohemian neighborhood — streets covered in graffiti art, independent bookshops, vinyl record stores, and an almost absurd density of bars. The <em>previa</em> culture here is strong: on matchday evenings, bars fill with fans watching the earlier fixtures on TV before heading to the stadium. It is a 15-minute metro ride from Allianz Parque (Palmeiras) and well connected to the rest of the city. Hostels here cater to the backpacker crowd and the prices are fair.</p>

        <h3>Liberdade</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The budget-conscious traveler and food lover. Liberdade is the historic Japanese-Brazilian neighborhood — red gates, lantern-lined streets, Asian grocery stores, and some of the best ramen and sushi outside of Japan. It is also one of the most affordable central neighborhoods for accommodation. Liberdade station (Line 1-Blue) puts you on the metro backbone, making all stadiums accessible. The neighborhood is vibrant during the day and relatively safe at night if you stick to the main streets.</p>

        <h3>Pinheiros</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who want a mix of comfort, food, and easy transport. Pinheiros is an upscale-but-not-sterile neighborhood with excellent restaurants, craft beer bars, farmers' markets (the Feira de Pinheiros on Saturday mornings is legendary), and a young, cosmopolitan population. Faria Lima station (Line 4-Yellow) and Pinheiros station (Line 4-Yellow / Line 9-Emerald) give you fast access to the metro network. More expensive than Liberdade or Vila Madalena, but the quality of life is higher and you are close to the Morumbi stadium.</p>

        <h3>Barra Funda</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Palmeiras fans or anyone who wants to be walking distance from Allianz Parque. Barra Funda is not the most charming neighborhood, but it is functional, affordable, and sits right on the doorstep of Palmeiras' home. Barra Funda station is a major transport hub connecting metro, CPTM trains, and long-distance buses. If you are in São Paulo primarily to see Palmeiras play, this is the most convenient base.</p>

            Areas to approach with caution
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Avoid staying near Cracolandia (around Luz station in the center) — the area has serious drug and safety issues, especially after dark. The immediate surroundings of Se station (Cathedral) are also best avoided at night. Itaquera (near the Corinthians stadium) is safe on matchday with police presence, but as a neighborhood for accommodation it is far from the center and less tourist-friendly. Stay in the recommended neighborhoods above and use metro and ride-hailing apps to reach outlying stadiums.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is a megacity with notoriously bad traffic. The good news is that every major stadium is connected to the metro or suburban rail network. Your goal is simple: use public transport on matchday and save ride-hailing apps for nighttime return trips.</p>

        <h3>The Bilhete Unico</h3>
        <p>São Paulo's transport card. Like Buenos Aires' SUBE, it is mandatory for all public transport — metro, buses, and CPTM trains. You can buy one at any metro station (bring your passport or a form of ID). Load it with credit and you are set. A single metro/bus ride costs around 4.40 BRL (less than 1 USD). The card allows free transfers between bus and metro within a three-hour window, making it extremely good value.</p>

        <h3>Metro</h3>
        <p>São Paulo's metro system has six lines covering the central and extended urban area. It runs from approximately 4:40 AM to midnight (Sundays from 4:40 AM to 11:00 PM). It is clean, fast, and efficient. The most useful lines for the traveling fan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Line 3-Red:</strong> Corinthians-Itaquera station (Neo Quimica Arena) and Palmeiras-Barra Funda station (Allianz Parque)</li>
          <li><strong>Line 9-Emerald:</strong> Morumbi station (Estadio do Morumbi, São Paulo FC)</li>
          <li><strong>Line 1-Blue:</strong> Jabaquara station (bus terminal for Santos / Vila Belmiro)</li>
          <li><strong>Line 4-Yellow:</strong> Connecting Paulista to Pinheiros and Butanta — useful for reaching Morumbi via bus</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CPTM (Suburban Trains)</h3>
        <p>The CPTM network extends the metro into the greater São Paulo suburbs. Line 7-Ruby connects to Palmeiras-Barra Funda. The trains are less polished than the metro but functional and cheap. Use the same Bilhete Unico card.</p>

        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>São Paulo has a massive bus network that covers every corner of the city, running on hundreds of routes 24 hours a day. Buses are useful for reaching stadiums from metro stations (especially Morumbi) and for getting around neighborhoods that the metro does not serve. Google Maps gives you accurate real-time routing. Pay with Bilhete Unico.</p>

        <h3>Uber / 99</h3>
        <p>Both Uber and 99 (a Brazilian ride-hailing app) work extensively in São Paulo. They are affordable by international standards and are the best option for getting back from the stadium at night after the metro closes. Tip: 99 is often cheaper than Uber in São Paulo and is widely used by locals. Download both apps before your trip. Surge pricing on matchday evenings is common — be patient and wait for prices to normalize 20-30 minutes after the final whistle.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport</h3>
        <p><strong>Guarulhos (GRU) — International airport:</strong> Located 25 km northeast of the city center. Options: Airport Express bus to Paulista/Republica (about 50 BRL, takes 60-90 minutes), taxi (around 150-180 BRL fixed rate), Uber/99 (80-120 BRL depending on traffic and time), or CPTM Line 13-Jade to Engenheiro Goulart station connecting to Line 3-Red metro (cheapest option, about 10 BRL total, but slower). <strong>Congonhas (CGH) — Domestic airport:</strong> Located within the city, near Morumbi. Taxi or ride-hailing app to Paulista Avenue takes 15-25 minutes and costs 25-40 BRL. Very convenient.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: PRE-MATCH ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-previa">The São Paulo Pre-Match Scene &amp; Food</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is Brazil's gastronomic capital, and that extends to the stadium surroundings. The <em>previa</em> (pre-match ritual) here is a celebration of food, beer, and chanting that starts hours before kickoff.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at Neo Quimica Arena</h3>
        <p>The esplanade between Corinthians-Itaquera metro station and the stadium gates transforms into a massive open-air party on matchday. Street vendors sell grilled meats, pasteis, coxinhas, and ice-cold chopp (draft beer). Corinthians fan groups set up drums and flags, and the chanting starts long before the turnstiles open. This is one of the best pre-match experiences in all of Brazil. Arrive early and soak it in.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at Allianz Parque</h3>
        <p>The area around Barra Funda has several bars that fill with Palmeiras fans before the match. The streets between the metro station and the stadium have food stalls and informal gatherings. The Palmeiras fan shop on-site is massive and worth browsing. The commercial area along Rua Palestra Italia hosts pre-match bars where the Verdao faithful gather over chopp and chant their lungs out.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at Morumbi</h3>
        <p>The streets surrounding the Morumbi are more residential and less concentrated than the other stadiums. However, there are bars and restaurants along Avenida Giovanni Gronchi and near the stadium gates where São Paulo FC fans congregate. The food stalls at the stadium entrance sell the classics: coxinha, pastel, and chopp. The atmosphere builds more gradually here but peaks dramatically once you are inside.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat and Drink</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coxinha:</strong> The undisputed king of São Paulo street food. A tear-drop shaped deep-fried snack filled with shredded chicken and cream cheese, coated in breadcrumbs. You will find them at every stadium, every bakery, every bar. Eat as many as you can. They cost almost nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>Pastel:</strong> A deep-fried pastry filled with ground meat, cheese, hearts of palm, or a dozen other options. The classic accompaniment is caldo de cana (sugarcane juice). The pasteis at São Paulo's street fairs are legendary — the Feira da Liberdade on Sundays is a must.</li>
          <li><strong>Pizza paulistana:</strong> São Paulo has more pizzerias per capita than anywhere outside of Italy. Paulistano-style pizza is thick, generous with toppings, and often served with catupiry (Brazilian cream cheese). Try the classic calabresa (pepperoni) or portuguesa (ham, eggs, olives, onion). Bras and Bela Vista neighborhoods are pizza central.</li>
          <li><strong>Chopp:</strong> Draft beer served ice-cold in a tulip glass. This is the default drink at every pre-match gathering. Brahma and Skol are the popular brands, but São Paulo has a booming craft beer scene — Vila Madalena and Pinheiros have dozens of craft beer bars.</li>
          <li><strong>Mortadella sandwich:</strong> The Mercadao (Municipal Market) downtown serves the legendary mortadella sandwich — a mountain of Italian mortadella layered in a crusty bread roll. It has nothing to do with football and everything to do with making your trip complete.</li>
          <li><strong>Cachaca and Caipirinha:</strong> Brazil's national spirit and cocktail. A proper caipirinha (cachaca, lime, sugar, ice) at a Vila Madalena bar before the match is a ritual you should not skip.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>São Paulo is a massive city with the typical safety challenges of any Latin American megacity. For the football tourist who takes sensible precautions, it is a safe and rewarding destination. Here are the rules to live by.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear a rival team's jersey near any stadium.</strong> This is the golden rule of Brazilian football and it applies even more strongly than in Argentina. A Corinthians jersey near Allianz Parque, or Palmeiras colors near Itaquera, can provoke a dangerous reaction. Keep your jersey in your bag until you are inside the stadium with your own section.</li>
          <li><strong>Phone discipline.</strong> São Paulo has a high rate of phone theft, especially near metro stations, at traffic lights, and on crowded streets. Keep your phone in your front pocket, do not walk and scroll, and be especially careful in crowded areas on matchday. Consider using a lanyard or wrist strap.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the metro and ride-hailing apps.</strong> Public transport is safe and efficient during operating hours. After the metro closes (midnight on weekdays, 11 PM Sundays), use Uber or 99 exclusively. Do not walk through unfamiliar neighborhoods at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid flashy displays of wealth.</strong> Do not wear expensive watches, jewelry, or carry visible cameras in the street. Keep your valuables at your accommodation and carry only what you need for the day.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay in recommended neighborhoods after dark.</strong> Paulista, Vila Madalena, Pinheiros, and Jardins are well-policed and safe at night. Luz, Se, and Republica areas in the historic center are best avoided after dark.</li>
          <li><strong>Matchday police instructions.</strong> Brazilian police at stadiums are firm and organized. Follow all instructions regarding entry routes, gate assignments, and post-match dispersal. Do not argue or try to take shortcuts. The system exists to keep you safe.</li>
          <li><strong>Documents and cash.</strong> Carry a photocopy of your passport. Some stadiums require ID to enter — check the club's website before matchday. ATMs inside malls are safer than street-facing ATMs. Withdraw cash during business hours in commercial areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel insurance.</strong> Brazil has excellent private hospitals but they are expensive. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical emergencies. Public hospital care (SUS) is free for everyone including tourists, but wait times can be long.</li>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Brazil's torcidas organizadas (organized fan groups) are large, passionate, and territorial. Do not enter their designated sections unless you are with them. Do not photograph or film members without permission. Do not engage in confrontations or provocations. These groups are a central part of the Brazilian football experience, but they operate by their own codes. Respect the boundaries, enjoy the spectacle from your section, and you will have no problems.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                The safest way is through the official websites of each club. Corinthians, Palmeiras, and São Paulo FC all sell tickets online — most require creating an account and some require a CPF (Brazilian tax ID number). For tourists without a CPF, authorized resellers and sports tourism agencies are the most reliable option. Some clubs offer ticket windows at the stadium on matchday for lower-demand fixtures. Never buy from street resellers (cambistas) or on social media — scams and counterfeit tickets are common. Prices range from 15 to 60 USD depending on the match and section.

              <span>Is São Paulo safe for foreign football fans?</span>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                São Paulo is generally safe for tourists who take standard precautions. Around stadiums on matchday there is heavy police presence. Stick to well-lit main streets, use ride-hailing apps (99 or Uber) at night, keep your phone in your front pocket, and avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics. The metro system is safe and efficient. Neighborhoods like Paulista, Pinheiros, and Vila Madalena are well-policed and tourist-friendly. Avoid wandering into unfamiliar areas after dark, especially near train stations in peripheral zones.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                Absolutely. All three stadiums are within São Paulo's metro network, making it easy to visit them in a single trip. Neo Quimica Arena (Corinthians) is on Line 3-Red at Corinthians-Itaquera station. Allianz Parque (Palmeiras) is near Barra Funda station on Lines 3 and 7. Morumbi (São Paulo FC) is accessible from the Morumbi station on Line 9-Emerald or via bus from other metro lines. You can realistically visit all three in a day if you plan your route, or better yet, spread them across multiple matchdays for the full experience.

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              <span>What is the CPF requirement for buying football tickets in Brazil?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                The CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Fisicas) is Brazil's individual taxpayer registration number. Many Brazilian football clubs require a CPF to purchase tickets online. As a foreign tourist, you can apply for a CPF at a Receita Federal office in Brazil or at a Brazilian consulate in your home country before traveling. Some clubs accept passport numbers instead. Alternatively, sports tourism agencies can purchase tickets on your behalf without you needing a CPF. Check each club's specific policy before matchday.

                The Brasileirao (Brazilian Serie A) runs from April to December, so any time in that window guarantees top-flight football. The Campeonato Paulista (São Paulo state championship) runs from January to April, featuring all the local clubs and derbies in a concentrated schedule — this is an excellent time to catch multiple matches in a short trip. Copa Libertadores group stages run from April to June, with knockout rounds through November. For weather, avoid July-August (winter — cold and dry) and January-February (summer — hot and rainy). March-May and September-November offer the best combination of weather and fixture density.

                Take the metro Line 1-Blue to Jabaquara station. From there, walk to the Jabaquara bus terminal which is connected to the metro station. Buy a bus ticket to Santos — services run frequently throughout the day and the journey takes 60-90 minutes depending on traffic (the Anchieta-Imigrantes highway can be congested on weekends). Once in Santos, take a local bus or taxi to Vila Belmiro — it is close to the city center. For the return after an evening match, buses back to São Paulo run until late, but verify the last departure time. Alternatively, you can rent a car or arrange a private transfer.
