LDU Quito sells tickets online and at the Rodrigo Paz Delgado ticket windows, typically opening sales two to three days before the match. El Nacional and Aucas sell at their respective grounds. For regular Liga Pro matches, tickets are generally available on the day — arrive 90 minutes early and queue at the boleteria. For derbies and Copa Libertadores nights, buy in advance as these sell out. Prices range from 5 to 20 USD depending on the section. Bring your passport, as ID is required for entry. Avoid buying from resellers outside stadiums, and do not accept tickets that look photocopied or lack a barcode."

          "text": "Quito sits at 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level — the highest major football city in South America and significantly higher than Bogota or La Paz's stadiums. The altitude will affect you, especially if arriving from sea level. Expect headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, and rapid fatigue. These symptoms intensify dramatically when you are jumping, singing, and celebrating for 90 minutes in a stadium. Arrive at least 24 to 48 hours before the match. Hydrate aggressively, avoid alcohol on your first day, eat light meals, and drink agua de guayusa or coca tea. Pharmacies sell Sorojchi Pills over the counter. The altitude is not just a fan problem — it is a tactical weapon. Visiting teams from Guayaquil (sea level) visibly struggle by the second half, and Quito clubs have built their entire competitive identity around this advantage."

          "text": "Yes, attending a match in Quito is generally safe with standard precautions. Ecuadorian football crowds are passionate but incidents involving foreign visitors are rare. Police presence at stadiums is significant on matchdays. The main risks are pickpocketing in crowded areas around the stadium and the occasional tension between barras bravas (organized fan groups). Avoid wearing rival team colors, do not photograph barras without permission, and leave the stadium promptly after the final whistle. Take a taxi or ride-hailing app rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. La Mariscal and La Floresta are safe areas with bars open after the match. The Centro Historico requires more caution after dark."

The best windows are March through June and August through November when the league is in full swing and Copa Libertadores or Copa Sudamericana matches may also be scheduled. Quito has a mild, spring-like climate year-round (10-21 degrees Celsius) due to its equatorial location and altitude. The drier months are June through September, which offer the most comfortable matchday conditions. The rainy season (October through May) brings afternoon downpours, but matches are typically played in the evening after the rain clears. Pack layers — Quito nights are cold, and stadium temperatures can drop to 8-10 degrees Celsius."

A backpacker can manage on 25 to 45 USD per day, including hostel accommodation (8-15 USD per night in La Mariscal or the Centro Historico), match tickets (5-20 USD), street food and local restaurants (2-6 USD per meal), and public transport on the Ecovia or Trolebus (0.25-0.35 USD per ride). A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 60 to 100 USD per day. A bowl of locro de papa costs 3-5 USD, llapingachos are 2-4 USD, and a canelazo (hot cinnamon drink with aguardiente) at a bar costs 2-4 USD."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY QUITO ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-quito">Why Quito?</h2>

        <p>Quito is the most extreme football city in South America. At 2,850 meters above sea level, it sits higher than Bogota, higher than La Paz's city center, and higher than any other major football capital on the continent. The altitude is not a footnote in Quito's football story — it is the story. It shapes everything: how teams play, how visitors suffer, how local clubs build their competitive identity, and how the stadiums sound when a sea-level side is gasping for air in the 70th minute and the home crowd smells blood.</p>

        <p>The city is home to three professional clubs that define Ecuadorian football. Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito — known simply as LDU or Liga — is the most decorated club in the country and the only Ecuadorian side to have lifted the Copa Libertadores, winning the continental title in 2008 in a campaign that stunned South American football. El Nacional, the military-affiliated club in red, carries a unique institutional identity and a fierce rivalry with LDU that splits the capital. Sociedad Deportiva Aucas, the people's club from the south of the city, completes the triangle with a passionate working-class fanbase that refuses to be overshadowed.</p>

        <p>Beyond football, Quito is a city of extraordinary beauty and historical weight. The Centro Historico is the best-preserved colonial center in South America — a UNESCO World Heritage Site of baroque churches, cobblestone plazas, and ornate convents stacked along hillsides that drop into deep Andean valleys. The city is surrounded by volcanoes. On a clear morning, you can see Cotopaxi, Cayambe, and the Pichincha range from the stadium stands. The combination of dramatic geography, colonial splendor, and raw football culture creates an away-day experience unlike anything else on the continent.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Quito, the altitude does the work that a twelfth man does elsewhere. You do not need to intimidate visiting players — the mountain does it for you. By the second half, their legs are heavy, their lungs burn, and our boys run like it is the first minute. This is our home advantage, and no one can take it away."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the traveling football fan, Quito also offers remarkable value. Ecuador uses the US dollar as its official currency, which eliminates exchange-rate headaches and makes budgeting straightforward. Match tickets are among the cheapest in South America, street food is outstanding and dirt cheap, and hostels in La Mariscal or the Centro Historico cost a fraction of what you would pay in Buenos Aires or Santiago. A full matchday — tickets, transport, food, and a few canelazos — can cost less than 20 dollars.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="must-visit-stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Quito has three football stadiums that host professional matches, each with its own character, history, and atmosphere. All three sit at 2,850 meters above sea level, making them among the highest professional football grounds in the world. The altitude is a constant: thinner air means the ball moves faster, goal kicks travel farther, and visiting players from the coast struggle with every sprint.</p>

        <!-- Rodrigo Paz Delgado -->
        <h3 id="rodrigo-paz-delgado">Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado (Casa Blanca) — LDU Quito</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~41,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Ponceano, northern Quito<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1997</p>

        <p>The Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado — universally known as Casa Blanca (White House) — is the crown jewel of Ecuadorian football. Built in the late 1990s and named after the club president who financed its construction, this is where LDU Quito plays its home matches and where the greatest moment in Ecuadorian club football history took place: the 2008 Copa Libertadores final, when Liga defeated Fluminense of Brazil on penalties to become the first and only Ecuadorian club to lift South America's most prestigious trophy.</p>

        <p>Casa Blanca is a modern, purpose-built football stadium with steep, enclosed stands that trap sound and create an intimidating atmosphere. The General Sur (south end) is where the Muerte Blanca — LDU's barra brava — operates, producing a relentless wall of noise, confetti, and smoke that does not stop for 90 minutes. The acoustics of the bowl design, combined with the altitude that makes sound carry differently in the thin air, create an atmosphere that has rattled some of the best clubs in South American history. Boca Juniors, River Plate, Sao Paulo, Gremio — they have all suffered here.</p>

        <p>The experience of watching a match at Casa Blanca on a big night — Copa Libertadores, a derby against El Nacional, or a title-deciding Liga Pro fixture — is one of the most intense in South American football. The combination of 40,000 fans, the bone-chilling altitude, the white confetti that makes the stadium look like a snowstorm, and the knowledge that the visiting team is fighting a battle against the mountain itself creates something truly unique.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Casa Blanca is located in the Ponceano neighborhood in northern Quito. The Ecovia and Trolebus BRT lines do not reach the stadium directly, but you can take the Metrobus line northward and then transfer to a feeder bus or take a taxi for the final stretch. From La Mariscal, a taxi costs 3-5 USD and takes 15-25 minutes depending on traffic. On matchday, the streets around the stadium fill with vendors and fans starting two hours before kickoff. Arrive early — traffic congestion in the final 30 minutes before the match is significant.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If LDU is playing a Copa Libertadores match, do whatever it takes to get a ticket. The Casa Blanca on a continental night is one of the top five stadium experiences in South America. The white confetti avalanche during the team's entrance is something you will never forget. Arrive 90 minutes early to soak in the pre-match atmosphere outside the stadium, where vendors sell hornado, empanadas, and canelazo to keep you warm in the cold Andean night.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Olimpico Atahualpa -->
        <h3 id="olimpico-atahualpa">Estadio Olimpico Atahualpa — El Nacional &amp; Ecuador National Team</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~35,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Iñaquito, north-central Quito<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1951 (renovated multiple times)</p>

        <p>The Estadio Olimpico Atahualpa is a monument to Ecuadorian football history. For decades, it was the country's national stadium and the primary venue for Ecuador's national team — the ground where the Seleccion qualified for its first-ever World Cup in 2002 and again in 2006, using the brutal altitude as a weapon against visiting South American sides. The Atahualpa has witnessed some of the most famous nights in Ecuadorian football: the 2001 victory over Brazil during World Cup qualifying, when the altitude reduced the Brazilian squad to walking pace by the second half, remains a defining moment in the country's sporting history.</p>

        <p>Today, the Atahualpa serves as the home ground for Club Deportivo El Nacional, the military club founded in 1964 and historically backed by Ecuador's armed forces. El Nacional plays in red and has a proud tradition of developing homegrown Ecuadorian talent — their policy of fielding only Ecuadorian players (no foreign signings) gives them a unique identity in a league increasingly reliant on imports. The fanbase is smaller than LDU's but deeply loyal, with a strong sense of institutional pride that mirrors the military values of the club's origins.</p>

        <p>The stadium itself shows its age. Built in 1951 and renovated several times since, the Atahualpa has an open, bowl-shaped design with a running track separating the stands from the pitch — a common feature of older South American stadiums that reduces the intimacy compared to Casa Blanca. On a quiet Liga Pro night, the 35,000-seat ground can feel cavernous with a few thousand fans scattered across the concrete terraces. But on a big night — a derby against LDU or a national team qualifier — the Atahualpa fills and the atmosphere is electric, amplified by the altitude and the weight of history embedded in the concrete.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> The Atahualpa enjoys the most central location of Quito's three stadiums, situated in the Iñaquito financial district. The Ecovia BRT line has a stop within walking distance, and the Trolebus line runs along Avenida 10 de Agosto nearby. From La Mariscal, it is a 10-15 minute walk. Taxis from most central neighborhoods cost 2-4 USD. The surrounding area has restaurants, shopping centers, and bars, making pre-match logistics easy.</p>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~20,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Chillogallo, southern Quito<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1958</p>

        <p>The Estadio Gonzalo Pozo Ripalda — known simply as "El Pozo" (The Well) or "Chillogallo" — is the home of Sociedad Deportiva Aucas, Quito's working-class club. Founded in 1945 by workers of the Shell Oil Company in the Ecuadorian Amazon (the name Aucas comes from the indigenous Waorani people, historically called Aucas by outsiders), the club relocated to Quito and built its identity as the team of the south, the team of the people, the club that draws its strength not from money or military backing but from the fierce loyalty of a fanbase that has endured decades of ups and downs.</p>

        <p>El Pozo is an intimate, atmospheric ground that sits in the working-class neighborhood of Chillogallo in southern Quito. With a capacity of roughly 20,000, it is the smallest of the three major Quito venues, but what it lacks in size it compensates for in intensity. The Aucas faithful — the Armageddon barra — create an extraordinary noise for their numbers, and the tight dimensions of the stadium mean you are close to the pitch and close to the action. On a derby night against LDU, El Pozo becomes a cauldron that is genuinely intimidating for visiting teams and exhilarating for anyone in the stands.</p>

        <p>Attending a match at El Pozo is a deeper cultural experience than the bigger stadiums. The surrounding neighborhood is authentically local — no tourist infrastructure, no craft beer bars, just families, street vendors, and a community that lives and breathes for their club. The atmosphere on the streets before a match is vibrant and welcoming. You will be one of very few foreign fans, and the locals will treat you with curiosity and warmth.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> El Pozo is located in southern Quito, a part of the city that most tourists never see. The Trolebus BRT runs south along Avenida Maldonado and can get you close, but the final stretch requires a taxi or a short walk through the Chillogallo neighborhood. From La Mariscal, a taxi takes 25-40 minutes and costs 5-8 USD depending on traffic. On matchday, follow the crowds — the streets around El Pozo fill with yellow-and-red-clad Aucas fans hours before kickoff.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">If you want the most authentic, street-level Ecuadorian football experience, go to El Pozo for an Aucas match. It is the antidote to sanitized modern football. The food stalls outside the ground serve some of the best hornado and llapingachos in Quito, and the matchday atmosphere in Chillogallo feels like a neighborhood festival. Take a taxi there and arrange your return ride in advance — ride-hailing apps work but can be slow to find drivers in that part of the city.</p>

        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Quito's derby scene is a three-way affair driven by geography, class, and institutional identity. The rivalries are real, rooted in history, and create some of the most intense atmospheres in Ecuadorian football. Here are the matches you need to see.</p>

        <!-- LDU vs El Nacional -->
        <h3 id="superclasico-quiteno">LDU Quito vs El Nacional — The Superclasico Quiteno</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 80/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Superclasico Quiteno is the biggest derby in the Ecuadorian capital and one of the most historic rivalries in Ecuadorian football. LDU Quito — the university club, the Libertadores champions, the team of the north — against El Nacional — the military club, the team of national pride, the squad built exclusively with Ecuadorian players. The ideological contrast is stark: LDU represents modernity, ambition, and continental glory; El Nacional represents tradition, patriotism, and a purist approach to the game that rejects foreign imports on principle.</p>

        <p>The rivalry intensified through the 1970s and 1980s when both clubs were competing for dominance in Ecuadorian football. El Nacional's golden era saw them win multiple national titles with squads composed entirely of Ecuadorian players — a point of immense pride for their fanbase, especially when they beat LDU sides bolstered by Argentine or Brazilian imports. LDU's response was to go bigger: invest, professionalize, and ultimately win the Libertadores in 2008, a feat El Nacional never came close to matching. That Libertadores title shifted the power dynamic permanently, and El Nacional fans carry the sting of being overshadowed.</p>

        <p>When this derby takes place at Casa Blanca, the atmosphere is ferocious. The Muerte Blanca fills the south end and unleashes a barrage of white confetti, flags, and non-stop chanting. El Nacional's Marea Roja (Red Tide) occupies the visiting section and responds with defiance, red smoke, and a determination to be heard. The pitch is contested with equal fury — tackles fly, tempers flare, and red cards are not uncommon. When the match moves to the Atahualpa, the dynamic shifts: El Nacional feeds off the home energy, and LDU's traveling contingent has to match them in a ground with less favorable acoustics for the away side.</p>

            Important note about the Superclasico
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">During the Superclasico Quiteno, sections are strictly divided. Do not wear white in the Nacional section or red in the LDU section. If you are a neutral, pick one side and commit to it — buy your ticket in that team's section and behave accordingly. After the match, leave immediately and take a taxi or ride-hailing app. The streets around both stadiums can be tense when the crowds pour out simultaneously. Avoid lingering near the barra sections after the final whistle.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LDU vs Aucas -->
        <h3 id="ldu-vs-aucas">LDU Quito vs SD Aucas — The North-South Divide</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 75/100</strong></p>

        <p>If the Superclasico Quiteno is about institutional identity, the LDU-Aucas rivalry is about class and geography. LDU draws its support from northern Quito — the wealthier, more modern part of the city, home to shopping centers, universities, and the financial district. Aucas draws from the south — the working-class barrios, the markets, the neighborhoods where football is not a lifestyle choice but a survival mechanism. The north-south divide in Quito is real and deeply felt, and this derby is its most vivid expression.</p>

        <p>Aucas fans take enormous pride in their underdog identity. They do not have the money, the trophies, or the continental pedigree of LDU, but they have something that cannot be bought: an organic, community-rooted fanbase that fills El Pozo with genuine emotion on derby day. The Armageddon barra creates an atmosphere that belies the stadium's modest size, and when Aucas scores against LDU, the eruption in Chillogallo can be heard blocks away.</p>

        <p>When this fixture is played at Casa Blanca, the LDU fans dominate the atmosphere, but the Aucas away section is always loud and defiant. When it moves to El Pozo, the power shifts entirely. LDU players have admitted in interviews that playing in Chillogallo is uncomfortable — the tight pitch, the hostile crowd right on top of you, the neighborhood atmosphere that makes you feel like you are playing in someone's backyard. For the visiting fan, experiencing both legs of this derby — one at Casa Blanca, one at El Pozo — gives you the full spectrum of Quito football.</p>

        <!-- Other matchups -->
        <h3 id="other-matchups">Other Notable Matchups in Quito</h3>

        <p>Beyond the local derbies, Quito hosts other compelling fixtures throughout the Liga Pro season that bring visiting fanbases and special atmospheres:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>LDU Quito vs Barcelona SC (Guayaquil):</strong> This is arguably the biggest rivalry in all of Ecuadorian football — the Sierra vs the Costa, Quito vs Guayaquil, the highland elite vs the coastal powerhouse. When Barcelona SC visits Casa Blanca, they bring a massive traveling contingent from the coast, but those fans are fighting the altitude from the moment they step off the bus. The atmosphere is extraordinary, and the tactical dimension — Barcelona's sea-level fitness against LDU's altitude advantage — adds genuine drama to every encounter.</li>
          <li><strong>El Nacional vs Aucas:</strong> The all-Quito matchup between the two clubs that play in LDU's shadow. Both fanbases carry chips on their shoulders and both are desperate to prove they matter in a city dominated by Liga. The atmosphere is raw and authentic, especially at El Pozo.</li>
          <li><strong>Copa Libertadores nights at Casa Blanca:</strong> When LDU draws a Brazilian or Argentine giant in the Libertadores, Casa Blanca becomes a fortress. The altitude advantage is at its most devastating in continental competition, where visiting squads from sea-level cities like Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, or Rio de Janeiro are visibly depleted by the second half. These matches are the highlight of the Quito football calendar.</li>
          <li><strong>Ecuador national team qualifiers at the Atahualpa:</strong> When the Seleccion plays World Cup qualifiers in Quito, the Atahualpa transforms into a cauldron. Ecuador's home record at altitude is formidable — they have beaten Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia here — and the crowd knows it. Qualifier nights in Quito are among the most electric atmospheres in South American football.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: THE ALTITUDE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="altitude">The Altitude Factor</h2>

        <p>This section deserves its own space because altitude is the single most defining factor of football in Quito — more important than any club, any stadium, or any derby. At 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level, Quito is the highest major football city in South America. The air contains roughly 27% less oxygen than at sea level. This affects absolutely everything.</p>

        <h3>What It Means for Players</h3>
        <p>Visiting teams from sea-level cities — Guayaquil, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Lima — arrive in Quito at a massive physiological disadvantage. The reduced oxygen means their muscles tire faster, their recovery between sprints is slower, and their aerobic capacity drops significantly. By the 60th minute, visiting players are often walking, hands on knees, struggling to track back. Quito-based clubs have built their entire tactical philosophy around this: play at a high tempo, press relentlessly in the second half, and exploit the moment when the visitors break. LDU's 2008 Libertadores campaign was built on this foundation — they were nearly unbeatable at Casa Blanca because no one could sustain 90 minutes against them at altitude.</p>

        <h3>What It Means for Fans</h3>
        <p>As a visiting fan, you will feel it. Climbing stadium stairs will leave you breathless. Jumping and singing for 90 minutes will exhaust you in a way that the same activity at sea level would not. Headaches, dizziness, and nausea are common on the first day. Alcohol hits harder and faster. Dehydration accelerates. If you arrive from Guayaquil, Lima, or any sea-level city and go straight to the stadium that evening, you will have a miserable experience. The altitude does not care about your enthusiasm.</p>

        <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive at least 24-48 hours before the match.</strong> Your body needs time to begin acclimatizing. Fly into Quito two days before the game and take it easy on day one.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrate aggressively.</strong> Drink 3-4 liters of water per day from the moment you arrive. Dehydration is the number one amplifier of altitude sickness.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid heavy alcohol on day one.</strong> A beer or two is fine. A binge session the night before the match will make you feel terrible at altitude. Save the heavy canelazo session for after the final whistle.</li>
          <li><strong>Eat light.</strong> Heavy meals combined with altitude create nausea and sluggishness. Stick to soups like locro de papa, which is warming and easy to digest.</li>
          <li><strong>Drink local remedies.</strong> Agua de guayusa (a tea made from Amazonian guayusa leaves, rich in caffeine and antioxidants) and coca tea are widely available and locals swear by them for altitude adjustment.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorojchi Pills.</strong> Available over the counter at any Fybeca or Sana Sana pharmacy. They contain aspirin, caffeine, and salofene, designed specifically for altitude sickness. Take one before the match if you are feeling rough.</li>
          <li><strong>Pace yourself at the stadium.</strong> Climb stairs slowly. Do not sprint to your seat. When you are jumping and singing with the crowd, take breaks. There is no shame in sitting down for a few minutes to catch your breath.</li>
        </ul>

            Altitude is not a joke
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Take the altitude seriously.</strong> Quito is 200 meters higher than Bogota and significantly higher than Cusco. Severe altitude sickness (acute mountain sickness) can include vomiting, severe headache, disorientation, and in rare cases, more serious complications. If your symptoms are severe and do not improve after 24 hours, see a doctor. Every hospital and clinic in Quito is experienced with altitude-related cases. People with heart or respiratory conditions should consult a doctor before traveling to Quito. Do not be a hero — if you feel terrible, rest and hydrate instead of forcing yourself to the stadium.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Quito is a long, narrow city squeezed between volcanic ridges, stretching roughly 40 kilometers from north to south but only about 5 kilometers wide. Choosing your base matters — the city's linear geography means that getting from one end to the other can take over an hour in traffic. These are the best neighborhoods for a football-focused visitor.</p>

        <h3>La Mariscal</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The ideal base for football fans and the default recommendation. La Mariscal — particularly the area around Plaza Foch — is Quito's backpacker and nightlife district. It has the highest concentration of hostels, hotels, restaurants, bars, and travel agencies in the city. The neighborhood sits in north-central Quito, within reasonable taxi distance of all three stadiums: 15-25 minutes to Casa Blanca, 10-15 minutes to the Atahualpa, and 25-40 minutes to El Pozo. La Mariscal is lively, cosmopolitan, and geared toward international visitors. Safety is decent on the main streets, though the usual precautions apply at night — avoid dark side streets and keep your phone out of sight. Hostels in La Mariscal run 8-15 USD per night for a dorm bed.</p>

        <h3>Centro Historico (UNESCO World Heritage Site)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The history lover and the budget traveler who wants atmosphere over convenience. Quito's Centro Historico is one of the most spectacular colonial centers in all of the Americas — a labyrinth of baroque churches, ornate plazas, grand convents, and narrow streets that have barely changed since the Spanish colonial era. The Basilica del Voto Nacional, the Iglesia de la Compania (one of the most opulent churches in South America), and the Plaza Grande are all here. Accommodation is cheap: hostels start at 8-12 USD per night. The drawbacks for football fans are distance (the Centro is south of La Mariscal and farther from Casa Blanca and the Atahualpa) and safety at night, which requires vigilance. After dark, take taxis rather than walking. During the day, the Centro Historico is unmissable.</p>

        <h3>La Floresta</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The traveler who wants something more authentic and artsy. La Floresta is a bohemian neighborhood east of La Mariscal, known for its art galleries, independent cinemas, organic cafes, craft beer bars, and a creative community that gives it a distinct character. It is quieter and more residential than La Mariscal, with a growing number of boutique hostels and Airbnbs. The location is good for the Atahualpa (15-20 minute walk) and reasonable for Casa Blanca (20-30 minutes by taxi). Safety is generally good. La Floresta is where you go for the excellent coffee, the craft cerveza after the match, and the conversations with local artists and students who make this neighborhood their home.</p>

        <h3>Iñaquito / La Carolina</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who want a modern, comfortable base with easy access to the Atahualpa. The Iñaquito area, centered around the Parque La Carolina and the Quicentro shopping center, is Quito's business and financial district. It has a range of mid-range to upscale hotels, modern restaurants, and the convenience of being within walking distance of the Olimpico Atahualpa. It lacks the charm and nightlife of La Mariscal, but it is clean, well-lit, and safe. A good option for travelers who prioritize comfort and proximity to the Atahualpa over backpacker atmosphere.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--danger">

            Areas to avoid
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Exercise caution in southern Quito, particularly at night.</strong> The neighborhoods south of the Centro Historico — including parts of La Marin, San Roque, and areas along Avenida Maldonado — have higher crime rates and are not recommended for tourists after dark. Chillogallo (near El Pozo) is fine on matchday with police presence and crowds, but take a taxi directly to and from the stadium rather than exploring the neighborhood at night. In La Mariscal, the area around Plaza Foch can attract petty crime after midnight on weekends — stay aware and avoid walking alone when intoxicated.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Quito's long, narrow geography makes transport planning essential. The city stretches north-south along a valley between two mountain ridges, and the three stadiums are spread across that length. Traffic can be brutal during rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM), so timing your matchday movement is critical. The altitude adds a complication: walking distances that look trivial on a map become exhausting when you are climbing hills at 2,850 meters with reduced oxygen.</p>

        <h3>Ecovia</h3>
        <p>The Ecovia is one of Quito's three BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) lines, running on dedicated lanes along Avenida 6 de Diciembre from the north to the south of the city. It is the most useful line for football fans, with stations close to La Mariscal, La Floresta, and the Iñaquito area near the Atahualpa. The fare is 0.25-0.35 USD per ride, making it one of the cheapest public transport systems in South America. The Ecovia is reasonably efficient during off-peak hours but becomes crushingly overcrowded during rush hour. On matchday, use it to get close to the Atahualpa, but for Casa Blanca or El Pozo, you will need to combine it with a taxi or feeder bus for the final stretch.</p>

        <h3>Trolebus</h3>
        <p>The Trolebus is Quito's original BRT line, running along Avenida 10 de Agosto through the center of the city, from the north through the Centro Historico and southward toward Chillogallo. This is the most useful line for reaching El Pozo (Aucas stadium) and the Centro Historico. It is also the oldest and most crowded of the three BRT systems. Same fare as the Ecovia. On matchday for an Aucas game, take the Trolebus south and then grab a taxi for the final stretch to the stadium.</p>

        <h3>Metrobus</h3>
        <p>The Metrobus runs along Avenida de la Prensa and Avenida America in the north of the city. It is the least useful of the three BRT lines for most tourists but can help with reaching the Ponceano area near Casa Blanca. The recently inaugurated Quito Metro (Line 1) also runs north-south and may provide additional options — check current route maps, as service is still expanding.</p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>Taxis in Quito are yellow, abundant, and cheap. A ride across the city rarely exceeds 8-10 USD, and short hops (La Mariscal to the Atahualpa, for example) cost 2-4 USD. Most taxis use meters, though some drivers may try to negotiate a fixed fare — insist on the meter. On matchday, taxis are the fastest and most convenient way to reach any of the three stadiums, though traffic congestion near the grounds in the final 30 minutes before kickoff can be severe. For the return trip after the match, walk a few blocks away from the stadium before hailing a cab.</p>

        <h3>Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
        <p>Uber operates in Quito and is widely used. InDrive (where you negotiate the fare) is also popular. These apps are your best bet for post-match transport, especially from El Pozo in southern Quito where taxis can be scarce. Request your ride as the match enters its final 10 minutes, and walk to a pickup point a few blocks from the stadium to avoid the worst of the post-match congestion.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport (Mariscal Sucre — UIO)</h3>
        <p>Quito's international airport, Mariscal Sucre, is located in Tababela, roughly 35 kilometers east of the city center. It was relocated from the old in-city airport in 2013, and the drive to the city takes 45-90 minutes depending on traffic and time of day. Options: the Aeroservicios airport shuttle bus (8 USD, runs every 30 minutes to the city center), taxis with fixed airport fares (25-30 USD to La Mariscal), or ride-hailing apps (15-25 USD depending on demand). The airport road descends from about 2,400m to the city at 2,850m — you will notice the altitude immediately upon arriving in the city, especially if you have flown in from sea-level Guayaquil.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
          <div class="info-box__title">

            Altitude and transport
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Do not underestimate walking distances at altitude. A 15-minute walk at sea level becomes a 25-minute slog at 2,850m, especially uphill. Quito's terrain is hilly, and many routes to the stadiums involve inclines. On your first day, take taxis everywhere. Save the walking for day two or three, once your body has started adjusting. Climbing the steep stairs inside stadiums will leave you gasping — go slowly and take breaks.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-and-previa">Food &amp; The Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>Ecuadorian food culture is hearty, warming, and perfectly calibrated for life at altitude. The cuisine of the Sierra (highland) region — where Quito sits — revolves around potatoes, corn, pork, and soups that warm you from the inside on cold Andean evenings. The pre-match eating scene around Quito's stadiums is an integral part of the matchday experience, and the food is some of the best and cheapest you will find anywhere in South America.</p>

        <h3>The Pre-Match Scene</h3>
        <p>On matchday, the streets surrounding each stadium transform into open-air food markets. At Casa Blanca, the blocks along the approach roads fill with vendors grilling hornado (slow-roasted whole pig), frying empanadas de viento (wind empanadas — puffed-up and hollow), and ladling out locro de papa from enormous pots. The smell of roasting pork and corn mixing with the cold mountain air is intoxicating. Fans gather in groups, eating standing up, passing bottles of canelazo (hot cinnamon and aguardiente), and warming their hands on cups of morocho (sweet corn drink). The drums of the Muerte Blanca can be heard from blocks away, building the atmosphere before the gates even open.</p>

        <p>At El Pozo, the pre-match scene is more intimate and more authentically local. The Chillogallo neighborhood comes alive: families set up tables outside their houses selling food, corner shops blast music, and the narrow streets fill with Aucas fans in yellow and red. The food here is arguably better than around Casa Blanca because you are eating at neighborhood stalls that serve these dishes every day, not just on matchday.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Locro de papa:</strong> Quito's signature dish and the ultimate pre-match fuel. A thick, creamy potato soup made with cheese, avocado, and served with a side of aji (spicy chili salsa). It is warming, filling, and easy to digest at altitude — exactly what you need before 90 minutes in a cold stadium. A bowl costs 3-5 USD at a traditional restaurant, less at a street stall.</li>
          <li><strong>Llapingachos:</strong> Pan-fried potato cakes stuffed with cheese, served with a peanut sauce, fried egg, chorizo, and salad. This is Ecuadorian comfort food at its finest — crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and absurdly cheap (2-4 USD for a full plate). Found at every market and many street stalls near the stadiums.</li>
          <li><strong>Hornado:</strong> Slow-roasted whole pig, typically served with llapingachos, mote (hominy corn), and curtido (a tangy onion-tomato salad). Hornado is the king of Ecuadorian street food and a matchday staple. The vendors outside Casa Blanca and El Pozo carve it fresh from whole pigs that have been roasting for hours. A full plate costs 3-5 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Empanadas de viento:</strong> Light, puffed-up empanadas filled with cheese and deep-fried until golden. They are called "de viento" (of wind) because they inflate during frying and are mostly hollow inside. Dusted with sugar, they are eaten as a snack with coffee or morocho. Less than 1 USD each.</li>
          <li><strong>Fritada:</strong> Braised and fried pork chunks, served with mote, llapingachos, and maduro (sweet plantain). Heavy, rich, and deeply satisfying. Not recommended before the match if you are worried about altitude nausea — save it for after.</li>
          <li><strong>Ceviche de chochos:</strong> A highland twist on coastal ceviche, made with chochos (Andean lupini beans) instead of seafood, mixed with tomato, onion, lime, and cilantro. Light, fresh, and a good option if you want something easy on the stomach before the match.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Drink</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Canelazo:</strong> The quintessential Quito matchday drink. A hot, spiced beverage made with naranjilla juice, cinnamon, cloves, sugar, and a generous measure of aguardiente (sugarcane spirit) or puntas (artisanal cane liquor). It warms you to the bone on a cold Quito night and is sold by vendors outside every stadium. A cup costs 1-2 USD on the street, 2-4 USD at a bar. Essential to the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Pilsener:</strong> Ecuador's most popular beer and the default matchday lager. Light, cold, and everywhere. A bottle at a street stall costs about 1-2 USD. The green-and-white cans are as ubiquitous at Ecuadorian football grounds as Quilmes at Argentine ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Club Premium:</strong> The slightly more upscale Ecuadorian beer. Same company as Pilsener but with a bit more body. Available at bars and restaurants near the stadiums.</li>
          <li><strong>Morocho:</strong> A sweet, warm, non-alcoholic drink made from ground corn, milk, cinnamon, and sugar. Thick, creamy, and comforting. Sold at street stalls everywhere and perfect for warming up before a night match without adding alcohol to the altitude equation.</li>
          <li><strong>Agua de guayusa:</strong> A tea brewed from guayusa leaves, an Amazonian plant with naturally high caffeine content. Widely consumed in Quito as an energy boost and altitude remedy. Available at markets and some street stalls. Non-alcoholic and genuinely helpful for combating altitude fatigue.</li>
        </ul>

          <p class="info-box__text">The canelazo is the heart of the Quito matchday experience, but go easy if you have not acclimatized. The aguardiente in canelazo hits harder at 2,850m than it does at sea level, and dehydration from alcohol makes altitude sickness significantly worse. Have one or two to warm up before the match and save the serious drinking for afterward. Between canelazos, drink morocho or agua de guayusa to stay hydrated and alert. Your body will thank you in the morning.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">Ecuador uses the US dollar, which makes budgeting effortless for American visitors and straightforward for everyone else.

Withdraw cash before heading to the stadium — ATMs near football grounds are rare. Street vendors, market stalls, and most transport are cash-only. Carry small bills: vendors selling empanadas and canelazo outside the stadium rarely have change for a $20 note, let alone a $50 or $100.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Quito is a generally safe city for tourists, and most visitors — including football fans — have trouble-free experiences. However, like any large Latin American city, it has risks that require awareness and precaution, and the football context adds specific considerations.</p>

        <h3>Altitude Safety</h3>
        <p>This is the number one health risk for visiting football fans in Quito, and it has already been covered extensively in the Altitude Factor section above. To summarize: arrive early, hydrate, avoid heavy alcohol on day one, eat light, take Sorojchi Pills if needed, and do not push yourself at the stadium. The altitude at 2,850m is not merely uncomfortable — it is a genuine physiological challenge that can ruin your trip if you ignore it.</p>

        <h3>General Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear team colors on public transport.</strong> Keep your jersey in your bag until you are at the stadium. This is especially important on derby days and for any fixture involving LDU and El Nacional or Aucas.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your phone secure.</strong> Phone theft is the most common crime targeting tourists in Quito. Do not walk down the street with your phone in your hand. Keep it in your front pocket or inside pocket, especially near BRT stations and in crowded areas around the stadiums. At the match, be extra careful when taking photos — phones get snatched in stadium crowds.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps at night.</strong> After the match, take an Uber, InDrive, or taxi rather than walking through unfamiliar streets. This is particularly important after games at El Pozo, which is in a neighborhood that requires extra caution after dark.</li>
          <li><strong>La Mariscal night safety.</strong> Plaza Foch and the surrounding bars are popular with tourists and generally safe, but pickpocketing and opportunistic theft increase after midnight, especially on weekends. Do not flash expensive jewelry or cameras. Keep your valuables out of sight, and avoid walking alone when intoxicated.</li>
          <li><strong>Centro Historico: great by day, careful at night.</strong> The colonial center is safe during daytime with tourist activity and police presence. At night, the streets empty and risks increase. Avoid the areas east of the Centro (toward Panecillo hill) after dark, and take taxis rather than walking.</li>
          <li><strong>Express kidnappings:</strong> Rare but documented in Quito. Never get into an unmarked car or a taxi that already has passengers. Use official yellow taxis, ride-hailing apps, or taxis called by your hostel/hotel.</li>
          <li><strong>Carry copies, not originals.</strong> Leave your passport in the hotel safe and carry a photocopy. If you need the original for stadium entry, keep it in a money belt under your clothes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Football-Specific Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Barras bravas:</strong> LDU's Muerte Blanca, El Nacional's Marea Roja, and Aucas's Armageddon are organized fan groups that can be territorial and intense. As a foreign visitor, you are generally not a target, but do not enter their sections uninvited, do not photograph them without permission, and do not provoke or mock them. Stick to the general admission sections and enjoy the spectacle from a respectful distance.</li>
          <li><strong>Derby days:</strong> Tensions are highest during the Superclasico Quiteno (LDU vs El Nacional) and during LDU vs Aucas. On these days, plan your route to and from the stadium in advance, leave promptly after the final whistle, and take a taxi or Uber directly back to your accommodation.</li>
          <li><strong>Away fans:</strong> If you are attending a match as a supporter of the visiting team, be discreet outside the stadium. Do not wear visiting colors on public transport or in the streets. At the stadium, stay in the designated away section and leave with the escorted group if police are organizing exits.</li>
        </ul>

            About the barras bravas
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Ecuadorian barras bravas are less internationally notorious than their Argentine or Colombian counterparts, but they are still organized groups with strong territorial instincts. The Muerte Blanca (LDU) is the largest and most active in Quito. As a foreign fan, your best strategy is to sit in the general admission sections, soak in the atmosphere, and treat the barras as a spectacle to appreciate from a safe distance. Do not try to join them, do not bring cameras into their sections, and do not wear colors that could be misinterpreted. Respect the culture, stay in your lane, and you will have an incredible time.</p>

                The most reliable way is through official club websites or at the stadium box offices on matchday. LDU Quito sells tickets online and at the Rodrigo Paz Delgado ticket windows, typically opening sales two to three days before the match. El Nacional and Aucas sell at their respective grounds. For regular Liga Pro matches, tickets are generally available on the day — arrive 90 minutes early and queue at the boleteria. For derbies and Copa Libertadores nights, buy in advance as these sell out. Prices range from 5 to 20 USD depending on the section. Bring your passport, as ID is required for entry. Avoid buying from resellers outside stadiums, and do not accept tickets that look photocopied or lack a barcode.

                Quito sits at 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level — the highest major football city in South America and significantly higher than Bogota. The altitude will affect you, especially if arriving from sea level. Expect headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, and rapid fatigue. These symptoms intensify dramatically when you are jumping, singing, and celebrating for 90 minutes. Arrive at least 24 to 48 hours before the match. Hydrate aggressively, avoid alcohol on your first day, eat light meals, and drink agua de guayusa or coca tea. Pharmacies sell Sorojchi Pills over the counter. The altitude is not just a fan problem — it is a tactical weapon that Quito clubs exploit ruthlessly against visiting teams.

                Yes, attending a match in Quito is generally safe with standard precautions. Ecuadorian football crowds are passionate but incidents involving foreign visitors are rare. Police presence at stadiums is significant on matchdays. The main risks are pickpocketing in crowded areas around the stadium and the occasional tension between barras bravas. Avoid wearing rival team colors, do not photograph barras without permission, and leave the stadium promptly after the final whistle. Take a taxi or ride-hailing app rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. La Mariscal and La Floresta are safe areas with bars open after the match. The Centro Historico requires more caution after dark.

                The Liga Pro season in Ecuador runs from February through December, split into two stages. Football is played virtually year-round, making almost any month viable. The best windows are March through June and August through November when the league is in full swing and Copa Libertadores or Copa Sudamericana matches may also be scheduled. Quito has a mild, spring-like climate year-round (10-21 degrees Celsius) due to its equatorial location and altitude. The drier months are June through September, which offer the most comfortable matchday conditions. The rainy season (October through May) brings afternoon downpours, but matches are typically played in the evening after the rain clears. Pack layers — Quito nights are cold, and stadium temperatures can drop to 8-10 degrees Celsius.

                Quito is one of the most affordable football destinations in South America. Ecuador uses the US dollar, which simplifies budgeting. A backpacker can manage on 25 to 45 USD per day, including hostel accommodation (8-15 USD per night in La Mariscal or the Centro Historico), match tickets (5-20 USD), street food and local restaurants (2-6 USD per meal), and public transport on the Ecovia or Trolebus (0.25-0.35 USD per ride). A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 60 to 100 USD per day. A bowl of locro de papa costs 3-5 USD, llapingachos are 2-4 USD, and a canelazo at a bar costs 2-4 USD. The pre-match food stalls outside stadiums are even cheaper.
