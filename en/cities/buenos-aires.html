Most of the big clubs (Boca, River, Racing, Independiente, San Lorenzo) sell tickets online to members, and some release a quota for non-members for lower-demand matches. For high-demand matches like the Superclasico, you need to be a club member or know one who can transfer their spot. Never buy from street resellers or on social media — scams are extremely common. Some authorized sports tourism agencies offer packages that include tickets, transfers, and a guide, and they are a reliable option for foreign visitors."

However, walking around La Boca at night or straying from the main streets is not recommended. Arrive at the stadium early, stick to the main routes, and after the match take a taxi or ride-hailing app to get back to your accommodation. Never wear a River Plate jersey (or any rival team's kit) in the vicinity of La Boca."

For Libertadores matches or major derbies, prices can rise to 50-100 USD or more. Sports tourism packages that include tickets, transfers, and a guide cost between 80 and 200 USD. Adding public transport with a SUBE card (2-5 USD per day), street food (choripan + beer for 5-8 USD), and hostel accommodation (10-20 USD per night), a full matchday on a backpacker budget runs between 40 and 60 USD."

          "text": "Currently, Argentine league matches are played without visiting fans by AFA regulation. This means there is no away section in any stadium. If you want to see a Boca-River match, you need to get a ticket through the home team (whichever club is hosting that match), which requires being a club member. For foreign tourists, the most viable options are: hiring an authorized sports tourism agency that can secure tickets, or experiencing the atmosphere from bars and the pre-match scene around the stadium, which is an incredible experience in itself."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY BUENOS AIRES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-buenos-aires">Why Buenos Aires?</h2>

        <p>Buenos Aires is not just a city with football. Buenos Aires <em>is</em> football. No other city on the planet packs as many professional clubs into such a compact urban radius. Over 30 professional teams compete across the different tiers of Argentine football within Greater Buenos Aires, and at least five of them are continental giants with stadiums that every serious football fan should visit before they die.</p>

        <p>The football density of this city is staggering. You can have breakfast at a San Telmo cafe listening to two old men argue about the latest derby, have lunch in Avellaneda with a view of Racing's stadium, catch a bus to La Boca and walk through Caminito while bar speakers blast terrace chants, and end the day in Nunez watching the Monumental light up for a midweek Libertadores night. All in the same city. All on the same day.</p>

        <p>Football in Buenos Aires is not a sporting spectacle: it is a religion, an identity, a social system. Every neighborhood has its club. Every family is divided (or united) by colors. Every taxi driver has a fully formed opinion on the last penalty that should have been given. That intensity, that omnipresence, that daily passion is what makes Buenos Aires the number one destination on the planet for a traveling football fan.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Buenos Aires you don't need to go looking for football. Football finds you. It's on the walls, in the bars, on the subway, in every conversation. It's impossible to escape. And you won't want to."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the foreign visitor, Buenos Aires also offers a massive logistical advantage: it is a cosmopolitan city with good transport infrastructure, accommodation for every budget, incredible food, and an exchange rate that — historically — works in the tourist's favor. You can live a world-class football experience without emptying your wallet.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="must-visit-stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Buenos Aires has more legendary stadiums per square kilometer than any other city in the world. These are the five every traveling fan needs to know.</p>

        <!-- La Bombonera -->
        <h3 id="la-bombonera">La Bombonera — Boca Juniors</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 54,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> La Boca, Brandsen 805<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1940</p>

        <p>La Bombonera is not just a stadium: it is a physical phenomenon. It is the only stadium in the world that literally vibrates when the fans jump. The concrete structure, with its three vertical tiers stacked on one side and the low stand on the other, creates a resonance chamber that amplifies every chant to levels you have to experience in person to believe. Foreign journalists visiting for the first time invariably say the same thing: "no television broadcast can capture this."</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Subte Line C to Constitucion, then bus 29/64/152 right to the stadium entrance. You can also take a taxi or Uber directly — from the city center it is about 15-20 minutes without traffic. On matchday, traffic gets very heavy, so leave early.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10.29 3.86L1.82 18a2 2 0 0 0 1.71 3h16.94a2 2 0 0 0 1.71-3L13.71 3.86a2 2 0 0 0-3.42 0z"/><line x1="12" y1="9" x2="12" y2="13"/><line x1="12" y1="17" x2="12.01" y2="17"/></svg>
            Important note about La Boca
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at the stadium at least 2 hours before kickoff. Do not wear any rival team's jersey (especially River Plate) on the streets of La Boca. The neighborhood is safe near Caminito during the day, but avoid straying from main streets and do not stay after dark. After the match, take transport immediately — do not walk around the neighborhood at night.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Estadio Monumental -->
        <h3 id="estadio-monumental">Estadio Monumental — River Plate</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 84,567<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Nunez, Av. Figueroa Alcorta 7597<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1938 (renovated multiple times)</p>

        <p>The largest stadium in Argentina and one of the biggest in South America. The Monumental is a football cathedral that has hosted Libertadores finals, 1978 World Cup matches, and the U-20 World Cup final. Unlike La Bombonera, which intimidates with its verticality and vibration, the Monumental overwhelms with sheer scale. When 80,000 people sing in unison, the feeling is oceanic.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Subte Line D to Congreso de Tucuman, then a 15-minute walk or bus 29/130 to the stadium. The Mitre train (Tigre branch) to Nunez station puts you a few blocks away. The Nunez area is residential and calm — much more relaxed than La Boca for walking before and after the match.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Monumental offers guided tours (Museo River) that include pitch-side access. If you cannot attend a live match, the tour is an excellent alternative. The bars along Av. del Libertador, a few blocks from the stadium, are the classic pre-match gathering spot for River fans.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- El Cilindro -->
        <h3 id="el-cilindro">El Cilindro — Racing Club</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 51,389<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Avellaneda, Colon 360<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1950</p>

        <p>The Estadio Presidente Peron, known as El Cilindro for its distinctive shape, is the home of Racing Club and one of the venues for the Avellaneda derby — one of the most intense rivalries in Argentine football. The stadium sits literally meters from Independiente's Libertadores de America, making Avellaneda a zone of maximum tension on derby day. Racing's fanbase (La Guardia Imperial) is one of the most loyal in the country: they fill the stadium in the first division, in the second division, and in anything else.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Roca train from Constitucion to Avellaneda station (15 minutes), then a short walk. Also buses 17, 22, 79, 93 from various points around the city.</p>

        <!-- Libertadores de América -->
        <h3 id="libertadores-de-america">Libertadores de America — Independiente</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 42,069<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Avellaneda, Bochini 751<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1928 (renovated 2009)</p>

        <p>Home of the "Rey de Copas" (King of Cups) — Independiente holds more Copa Libertadores titles than any other club in the world (7 titles). The stadium is named after the very competition the club dominated like no other. Though more modest in capacity than La Bombonera or the Monumental, the Libertadores de America has a particular mystique. El Rojo de Avellaneda has a passionate fanbase and a history that weighs in every corner of the ground.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Same route as El Cilindro — both stadiums are in Avellaneda, just a few blocks apart. From Avellaneda station on the Roca train line you can walk to both.</p>

        <!-- Estadio Diego Armando Maradona -->
        <h3 id="estadio-maradona">Estadio Diego Armando Maradona — Argentinos Juniors</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 24,800<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> La Paternal, Boyaca 2145<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1940</p>

        <p>The stadium where Diego Armando Maradona made his professional debut at the age of 15. That alone makes it a football pilgrimage site. Argentinos Juniors is known as the "Semillero del Mundo" (Seedbed of the World) for the number of legendary players who came through its youth system — Maradona, Riquelme (grew up in the neighborhood), Redondo, among others. The stadium is intimate, neighborhood-rooted, and has that quintessential Buenos Aires barrio football energy that the big stadiums cannot replicate.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Subte Line B to De los Incas-Parque Chas or San Martin station, then a 10-15 minute walk. Buses 47, 63, 65, 111, 176 serve the area.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: DERBIES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Buenos Aires is the world capital of derbies. No other city on the planet has as many intense rivalries packed into such a small area. These are the ones every traveling fan should have on their list.</p>

        <!-- Superclasico -->
        <h3 id="superclasico">Boca Juniors vs River Plate — The Superclasico</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 97/100</strong></p>

        <p>The most important club football match in the world. That is not an exaggeration — international polls and football experts consistently rank it as the planet's number one derby. Boca vs River is not just a match: it is a definition of identity, a class war, a division that cuts through entire families. Boca historically represents the working-class neighborhood of La Boca, the immigrant, the people. River represents (in popular imagination, with nuances) the upper-middle class, elegance, money. Those narratives, simplified as they are, fuel a passion that defies all logic.</p>

            The reality of getting tickets
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Getting tickets for a Superclasico is extremely difficult. Matches are played without visiting fans, so you can only attend from the home side, which generally requires being a member with seniority. Sports tourism agencies are the most viable option for tourists, but prices are steep (100-300 USD). Never buy from street resellers or on social media.</p>

        <!-- Clasico de Avellaneda -->
        <h3 id="clasico-avellaneda">Racing Club vs Independiente — Clasico de Avellaneda</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 82/100</strong></p>

        <p>Two stadiums separated by just a few blocks in the same city: Avellaneda. Racing and El Rojo hate each other with an intensity that can only be understood by living in that neighborhood. What makes this derby unique is the geographical proximity — you can stand at a single point in Avellaneda and see both stadiums. That closeness generates a permanent tension that does not need matchday to exist. On derby day, the area transforms: mounted police, closed streets, helicopters. It is a spectacle in itself.</p>

        <!-- Clasico del Barrio -->
        <h3 id="clasico-barrio">San Lorenzo vs Huracan — Clasico del Barrio</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 78/100</strong></p>

        <p>The neighborhood derby of Boedo (though San Lorenzo currently does not have their own stadium in the area — a sore subject for their fans). San Lorenzo, one of Argentina's five biggest clubs, against Huracan, the "Globo" whose loyal and combative fanbase punches well above their weight. This derby has a neighborhood flavor — the kind of corner-bar, old-bodega authenticity that the big televised derbies lack. If you are looking for genuine, unfiltered football, this is your match.</p>

        <!-- Other derbies -->
        <h3 id="other-derbies">Other Buenos Aires Derbies</h3>

        <p>Buenos Aires has more derbies than you can count. Some that deserve a mention:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boca vs San Lorenzo:</strong> Two of the big five. Always competitive, always tense.</li>
          <li><strong>River vs Racing:</strong> Historically charged. Racing's fans travel well as visitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Velez vs Ferro:</strong> The derby of Buenos Aires' western zone. More neighborhood-level, less media coverage, but with genuine local intensity.</li>
          <li><strong>Atlanta vs Chacarita:</strong> The Villa Crespo derby. Lower division football with top-flight passion.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Choosing where to sleep in Buenos Aires is key to your football experience. Not all neighborhoods are equal in terms of access, safety, and atmosphere. These are your best options.</p>

        <h3>San Telmo</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The traveling fan who wants to be at the center of everything. San Telmo is central, has the best nightlife in the city, is packed with bars showing live football, and is a 20-minute bus ride from La Boca. Sundays bring the Defensa street fair with tango, antiques, and atmosphere. Good balance of price, location, and safety. Plenty of hostels and Airbnbs at reasonable prices.</p>

        <h3>Palermo</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who prioritize safety and comfort. Palermo is the most modern and safest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Palermo Soho and Palermo Hollywood have the highest concentration of restaurants, bars, and shops in the city. Good Subte connections (Lines D and B) to reach almost any stadium. More expensive than San Telmo, but the peace of mind is worth it.</p>

        <h3>Constitucion</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The backpacker on a tight budget. Constitucion has the cheapest hostels in the city and is strategically located: Constitucion station has trains to Avellaneda (Racing, Independiente) and buses to La Boca (Boca Juniors). The station area can be unsafe at night — be cautious and avoid walking alone after 10 PM.</p>

        <h3>Nunez</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone who is specifically coming to see River Plate. Nunez is a residential, quiet, and safe neighborhood, just a few blocks from the Monumental. It does not have the nightlife of Palermo or San Telmo, but it has the advantage of being within walking distance of the stadium. Along Av. del Libertador there are several bars and restaurants with a good football atmosphere.</p>

            Area to avoid
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Do not stay in La Boca.</strong> Although it is the most iconic football neighborhood in Buenos Aires, it is not a safe area to sleep in. Caminito is touristy during the day, but the neighborhood in general has safety issues after dark. Visit La Boca during the day, for the match, and then head back to your accommodation in another neighborhood.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Getting around Buenos Aires is relatively straightforward once you understand the system. Here are the essentials.</p>

        <h3>The SUBE Card</h3>
        <p>Mandatory for all public transport. Without a SUBE card you cannot board the Subte or any bus. You can buy one at kiosks and Subte stations for very little money (less than 1 USD) and top it up at the same locations or via the app. All public transport in Buenos Aires runs on SUBE: metro, buses, urban trains. It is the first thing you need to purchase when you arrive.</p>

        <h3>Subte (Metro)</h3>
        <p>6 lines covering the central area of the city. It runs approximately from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM (Sundays until 10:00 PM). It is fast, cheap, and efficient for moving around downtown and connecting with bus routes. The most useful lines for the traveling fan: Line C (to connect with trains to Avellaneda from Constitucion), Line D (to reach Nunez/Monumental), Line B (to La Paternal/Argentinos Jrs).</p>

        <h3>Colectivos (Buses)</h3>
        <p>Buenos Aires' bus network is enormous and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is the transport that takes you where the Subte cannot reach — including most stadiums. You pay with SUBE. Key lines for stadiums: 29, 64, 152 (La Bombonera), 29, 130 (Monumental), 17, 22, 79, 93 (Avellaneda). Google Maps or the Como Llego app give you exact combinations in real time.</p>

        <h3>Uber / Cabify</h3>
        <p>Both apps work well in Buenos Aires. Uber technically operates in a legal gray area, but in practice it works without issues and millions of people use it. Tip: many Uber drivers ask for cash payment to avoid commissions — have Argentine pesos on hand. Cabify is the 100% legal alternative. For getting back from the stadium at night, ride-hailing apps are your best bet.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport</h3>
        <p><strong>Ezeiza (EZE) — International airport:</strong> Located 35 km from the city center. Options: Tienda Leon (direct bus to downtown, terminal at Madero, approx. 10-15 USD), official Ezeiza taxi (30-40 USD), private transfer (30-50 USD), Uber/Cabify (20-30 USD, though there can be delays at Ezeiza). <strong>Aeroparque (AEP) — Domestic and regional flights:</strong> Located within the city itself, 15 minutes from downtown. Any taxi, Uber, or bus will get you there quickly and cheaply.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: PRE-MATCH ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="pre-match">The Buenos Aires Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>The pre-match ritual in Buenos Aires is sacred. Regardless of the stadium or the fixture, hours before kickoff the surroundings of every ground transform into a street party of food, chanting, flags, and grill smoke.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at La Boca</h3>
        <p>The Caminito area and the streets near Brandsen (where La Bombonera stands) fill up with street food stalls, merchandise sellers, and fans singing hours before the match. There are bars on Brandsen and Almirante Brown where you can grab something to eat and soak in the atmosphere. Be mindful: the area is intense and police presence is heavy. Stick to the main streets and do not wander away from the tourist/football circuit.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at Nunez</h3>
        <p>More relaxed than La Boca. The bars along Av. del Libertador, a few blocks from the Monumental, are the classic gathering point for River fans. The area is residential and safe. You can walk around freely, have a beer on the sidewalk, and enjoy the pre-match atmosphere without tension.</p>

        <h3>Pre-match at any stadium</h3>
        <p>A universal rule in Buenos Aires: choripan stands appear 3-4 hours before any match, in the vicinity of any stadium. These are mobile carts with grills preparing choripan (chorizo sausage in bread), bondiola (slow-roasted pulled pork in bread), and sometimes burgers. The smell of the grill is your signal that you are near the ground. It is cheap, it is delicious, and it is an essential part of Argentine football liturgy.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat and Drink</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choripan:</strong> The undisputed classic. Grilled chorizo sausage in French bread, with chimichurri or salsa criolla. Found on every corner near a stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Bondiola:</strong> Slow-roasted pulled pork served in bread. Juicier and more filling than choripan. The best stalls always have a queue.</li>
          <li><strong>Empanadas:</strong> Beef empanadas are the most popular. Buy from neighborhood bakeries, not from dodgy street stalls.</li>
          <li><strong>Fernet con Coca:</strong> The official drink of Argentine youth. Fernet-Branca mixed with Coca-Cola. It is an acquired taste — try it at least once.</li>
          <li><strong>Beer:</strong> Quilmes is the iconic popular brand. At pre-match bars, a pint costs almost nothing.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Buenos Aires is a safe city for tourists if you take the standard precautions of any large Latin American metropolis. In the football context, there are some additional rules worth following.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear any team jersey on public transport.</strong> Especially on matchday. The jersey stays in your backpack until you are at the stadium with your fellow fans. This applies especially to jerseys of teams that are rivals of whoever is playing near where you are.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your phone in your front pocket.</strong> Phone theft is the most common crime in Buenos Aires. Avoid taking it out on the street while walking, especially near train and Subte stations. Use wired earphones (harder to snatch).</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps at night.</strong> After the match, especially if it finishes late, take an Uber, Cabify, or remis (car with driver). Do not walk alone through unfamiliar areas at night.</li>
          <li><strong>La Boca: safe during the day (Caminito area), avoid at night.</strong> The tourist area of La Boca has police presence during the day and at match time. But the surrounding streets and the neighborhood in general are not safe for walking at night, especially for tourists.</li>
          <li><strong>Constitucion station area: be alert at night.</strong> The area around Constitucion train station is a complicated spot after 10 PM. If your hostel is in Constitucion, return by taxi or ride-hailing app after dark.</li>
          <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Carry a photocopy of your passport or ID and leave the original at your accommodation. To enter the stadium you need ID (original or photocopy depending on the club), so check the requirements before you go.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Do not carry more than you need for the day. ATMs near stadiums are scarce and have long queues on matchday. Withdraw cash in advance.</li>
        </ul>

            About visiting fans
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Currently, Argentine football is played without visiting fans for the majority of league matches. This means everyone in the stadium is a home supporter. If you are a fan of the visiting team and manage to get a ticket, behave with discretion — do not chant, do not celebrate rival goals, do not wear visiting colors. This is not cowardice, it is common sense.</p>

                The safest way is through the official channels of each club. Most of the big clubs (Boca, River, Racing, Independiente, San Lorenzo) sell tickets online to members, and some release a quota for non-members for lower-demand matches. For high-demand matches like the Superclasico, you need to be a club member or know one who can transfer their spot. Never buy from street resellers or on social media — scams are extremely common. Some authorized sports tourism agencies offer packages that include tickets, transfers, and a guide, and they are a reliable option for foreign visitors.

                The Caminito area and the surroundings of La Bombonera are safe during the day and at match time, when there is a massive police presence. However, walking around La Boca at night or straying from the main streets is not recommended. Arrive at the stadium early, stick to the main routes, and after the match take a taxi or ride-hailing app to get back to your accommodation. Never wear a River Plate jersey (or any rival team's kit) in the vicinity of La Boca.

                It depends on the stadium and the match. A popular ticket (standing terrace) for a regular league match costs between 15 and 40 USD. For Libertadores matches or major derbies, prices can rise to 50-100 USD or more. Sports tourism packages that include tickets, transfers, and a guide cost between 80 and 200 USD. Adding public transport with a SUBE card (2-5 USD per day), street food (choripan + beer for 5-8 USD), and hostel accommodation (10-20 USD per night), a full matchday on a backpacker budget runs between 40 and 60 USD.

                Currently, Argentine league matches are played without visiting fans by AFA regulation. This means there is no away section in any stadium. If you want to see a Boca-River match, you need to get a ticket through the home team (whichever club is hosting that match), which requires being a club member. For foreign tourists, the most viable options are: hiring an authorized sports tourism agency that can secure tickets, or experiencing the atmosphere from bars and the pre-match scene around the stadium, which is an incredible experience in itself.
