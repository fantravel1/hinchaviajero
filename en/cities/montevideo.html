For high-demand matches — especially the Clásico between Nacional and Peñarol — tickets sell out fast, and you may need to purchase through the home club's official website or authorized resellers. Some clubs also sell tickets at RedPagos and Abitab outlets across the city. Prices for regular league matches range from 8 to 25 USD. Never buy from street resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets are a known issue during big matches."

The central areas (Ciudad Vieja, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, Cordón) are walkable and well-policed during the day. On matchday, take standard precautions: do not wear a rival team's jersey near the stadium, keep valuables hidden, and use taxis or ride-hailing apps to return from night matches. The area around Estadio Centenario (Parque Batlle) is residential and calm. Ciudad Vieja can feel quieter after dark on weekdays, so stick to main streets at night."

Buquebus prices vary from 40 to 120 USD depending on the class and how far in advance you book. You can also fly — the Buenos Aires-Montevideo route is short (45 minutes), and budget airlines sometimes offer fares under 50 USD. Bus services also run between the two cities (8-9 hours, 30-50 USD)."

The best months for football travel are March to May (autumn — pleasant weather, league fully underway) and September to November (spring — weather warming up, playoff races heating up). Summer (December-February) is holiday season, and many matches are rescheduled or lower in attendance. If you want the Clásico, check the fixture schedule in advance — Nacional vs Peñarol is typically played 2-3 times per season across different competitions."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Why Montevideo?</h2>

        <p>Montevideo is where it all started. On July 30, 1930, in a brand-new stadium built in record time on the edge of Parque Batlle, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2 to win the very first FIFA World Cup. That match, that stadium, and that moment defined modern football as a global phenomenon. Every World Cup that has ever been played since — from Italy 1934 to wherever the tournament goes next — traces its lineage back to Montevideo.</p>

        <p>But Montevideo is not a city that lives in the past. The football here is alive, visceral, and deeply embedded in daily life. Uruguay, a country of just 3.5 million people, has produced more world-class footballers per capita than any other nation on earth. Suarez, Cavani, Forlan, Francescoli, Recoba, Ghiggia, Schiaffino — the list is absurd for a country this small. And they all came through the clubs of Montevideo, through the youth systems of Nacional, Peñarol, Danubio, Defensor Sporting, and the rest.</p>

        <p>The city itself is a gift for the traveling fan. Compact, walkable, affordable, with a laid-back Rioplatense charm that sits somewhere between Buenos Aires' intensity and a coastal town's calm. You can walk from Ciudad Vieja to the Centenario in 40 minutes. You can eat an asado on a Sunday afternoon, take a bus to the stadium, watch a match, and be back at a bar in Pocitos drinking medio y medio by midnight — all without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Montevideo does not have the scale of Buenos Aires or the spectacle of Rio. What it has is something rarer: a football culture so deeply woven into the city that you cannot separate one from the other. Here, football is not entertainment. It is oxygen."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the visiting fan coming from Buenos Aires, Montevideo is a natural extension of the River Plate football pilgrimage. The Buquebus ferry crosses the Rio de la Plata in just over two hours, depositing you in a city that shares the same footballing DNA — the same tactical intensity, the same garra charrua spirit, the same corner-bar debates — but with its own distinct identity. If Buenos Aires is football's New York, Montevideo is its Boston: smaller, proud, deeply historic, and convinced it does things better.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Montevideo has three stadiums that every serious football fan should know. Each one represents a different era and a different dimension of Uruguayan football history.</p>

        <!-- Estadio Centenario -->
        <h3 id="estadio-centenario">Estadio Centenario — The Cathedral</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 60,235<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Parque Batlle, Av. Dr. Americo Ricaldoni s/n<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1930<br>
        <strong>UNESCO Status:</strong> Historic Monument of World Football (1983)</p>

        <p>The Estadio Centenario is not just a stadium. It is a UNESCO-recognized monument, the birthplace of the World Cup, and the spiritual center of Uruguayan football. Built in just eight months for the 1930 tournament, its distinctive feature is the Torre de los Homenajes (Tower of Tributes) — a 100-meter-tall tower that rises from the main stand and has become the symbol of the ground. When it was inaugurated, it was the largest football stadium in the world.</p>

        <p>Today, the Centenario serves as the home ground for the Uruguayan national team and is used for high-profile club matches, including many rounds of the Clasico between Nacional and Peñarol. It also houses the Museo del Futbol, which chronicles the 1930 World Cup, Uruguay's two World Cup triumphs (1930, 1950), and the broader history of South American football. Walking through the museum and then stepping out onto the terrace with a view of the pitch is a genuinely moving experience for anyone who loves this sport.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Multiple bus lines run along Av. 8 de Octubre and Bulevar Artigas, both of which border Parque Batlle. From Ciudad Vieja or the Centro, buses 104, 306, 405, and many others pass within walking distance. From Pocitos, it is a 20-minute walk through the park. On matchday, the surrounding streets fill up with fans, food vendors, and a carnival atmosphere that starts 2-3 hours before kickoff.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Visit the Museo del Futbol even if you are attending a match. Open weekdays and some Saturdays, the museum alone is worth the trip to Parque Batlle. The collection includes the ball from the 1930 World Cup final, original jerseys, and rare footage from the earliest years of international football. Combined with a stadium tour, it is one of the best football museum experiences in all of South America.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Gran Parque Central -->
        <h3 id="gran-parque-central">Gran Parque Central — Nacional</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 34,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> La Blanqueada, Dr. Jose Zorrilla de San Martin 1132<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1900</p>

        <p>Gran Parque Central holds a record that no stadium in the world can match: it hosted the very first match in World Cup history. On July 13, 1930, France defeated Mexico 4-1 here, before the Estadio Centenario was finished. But the ground's history goes far deeper than that single match. It has been Nacional's home since 1900, making it one of the oldest continuously used football grounds in the world.</p>

        <p>Nacional — Club Nacional de Football, to use its full name — is one of the two giants of Uruguayan football. Founded in 1899 as the first club created by Uruguayans (rather than by British residents), Nacional represents national identity, tradition, and a working-class pride that runs deep. Their colors are red, white, and blue, and their fans (the Bolsos) are among the most passionate in South America. Gran Parque Central, recently renovated, is an intimate ground where you sit close to the pitch and feel every chant reverberate through the concrete.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Located in La Blanqueada, a central neighborhood easy to reach by bus from anywhere in the city. Multiple lines run along Bulevar Artigas and Av. 8 de Octubre. From the Centro, it is about 15-20 minutes by bus or a 30-minute walk. The surrounding streets have several bars and food stalls that come alive on matchday.</p>

        <!-- Campeon del Siglo -->
        <h3 id="campeon-del-siglo">Campeon del Siglo — Peñarol</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 40,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Barrio Sayago, Camino Maldonado 8801<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 2016</p>

        <p>After decades of playing as tenants at the Centenario and other grounds, Peñarol finally inaugurated their own modern stadium in 2016. The Campeon del Siglo (Champion of the Century — a nod to the club being named South America's best club of the 20th century) is the newest major football ground in Uruguay, and it represents Peñarol's ambition to match their historical greatness with modern infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Peñarol — officially Club Atletico Peñarol — is the other giant. Founded in 1891 (as the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club, later adopting football), Peñarol has won five Copa Libertadores titles, three Intercontinental Cups, and a staggering 51 Uruguayan league championships. Their fans (the Carboneros, or Aurinegros) are fanatically loyal and fill the Campeon del Siglo with a wall of gold and black on matchday. The atmosphere in the new stadium, despite its modern construction, is raw and intense — Peñarol fans made sure of that.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> The stadium is located in Sayago, on the eastern edge of the city, further from the center than the Centenario or Gran Parque Central. Buses run along Camino Maldonado, and on matchday there are usually extra services. From the Centro, expect a 30-40 minute bus ride. Taxis and Uber are the most convenient option, costing around 8-12 USD from Pocitos or Ciudad Vieja. Plan ahead for the return trip — after the match, ride-hailing demand spikes.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Because the stadium is further from the city center, plan your transport in advance — especially for the return trip. After the match, the area around the stadium empties quickly and ride-hailing availability can be limited. Arrange your return before entering the ground, or walk to Camino Maldonado where buses are more frequent.</p>

        <h2 id="derbies">The Derby: Nacional vs Peñarol</h2>

        <p>El Clasico del futbol uruguayo. Nacional versus Peñarol. The oldest derby in the Americas, contested since 1900. Over 600 matches played. A rivalry that has defined Uruguayan football for more than a century and that, for sheer historical weight, stands alongside any derby on the planet.</p>

        <h3 id="el-clasico">El Clasico — Nacional vs Peñarol</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 88/100</strong></p>

        <p>The roots of this rivalry run deeper than football. Nacional was founded in 1899 as a explicitly Uruguayan club — a response to the British-dominated sports clubs of the era. Peñarol traces its origins to the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club, founded by British railway workers in 1891. From the very beginning, this was a clash of identities: the native versus the foreign, the Criollo versus the English. Those narratives have evolved over the decades, but the intensity has never dimmed.</p>

        <p>Today, Nacional and Peñarol between them have won the vast majority of Uruguayan league titles and continental trophies. Peñarol leads in league championships (51 to Nacional's 49), while Nacional edges ahead in Copa Libertadores titles (3 to 5). Every statistic, every record, every historical claim is contested and debated endlessly. In Montevideo, you are either Bolso (Nacional) or Carbonero (Peñarol). There is no middle ground. Asking someone to be neutral about the Clasico is like asking them to stop breathing.</p>

        <p>The Clasico is played at different venues depending on the competition and demand. For the biggest editions, the Centenario is the chosen ground, with each team occupying half the stadium. The atmosphere on Clasico day is all-consuming: the city effectively shuts down, the streets around the stadium become a river of red-white-blue and gold-black, and the noise inside the ground is absolutely deafening. If you can attend only one match in Montevideo, make it this one.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">On Clasico day, choose your side and commit. Do not wear split colors or attempt to sit in the wrong section. The stadium is strictly divided, and police enforce the separation rigorously. Arrive early (2-3 hours before kickoff) and leave the area immediately after the final whistle. Avoid wearing any team colors on public transport after the match. The city is intense on Clasico day — enjoy the passion, respect the boundaries.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="other-clubs">Other Montevideo Clubs</h3>

        <p>Nacional and Peñarol dominate, but Montevideo has a rich ecosystem of smaller clubs with devoted followings. These are worth knowing:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Defensor Sporting:</strong> Based in Parque Rodo, Defensor is the "third force" of Uruguayan football. They have won multiple league titles and are known for their excellent youth development. Their home ground, Estadio Luis Franzini, is a compact, atmospheric venue right on the Rambla overlooking the river.</li>
          <li><strong>Danubio FC:</strong> From the Jardines del Hipodromo neighborhood, Danubio has produced a remarkable number of talented players relative to their size. A Danubio match is neighborhood football at its purest — small ground, loyal fans, tactical football.</li>
          <li><strong>Liverpool FC (Montevideo):</strong> Yes, there is a Liverpool in Montevideo. Founded in 1915 and named after the English city, they play in the Belvedere neighborhood. Their Estadio Belvedere is modest but has real character.</li>
          <li><strong>Wanderers:</strong> The oldest club in Uruguay still in existence (founded 1902, though their origins trace to 1891). Montevideo Wanderers play at the Estadio Alfredo Victor Viera in the Prado neighborhood. Small, historic, and deeply traditional.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Montevideo is a compact city, and most of its interesting neighborhoods are within walking distance of each other along the Rambla (the coastal promenade that runs the length of the city's waterfront). Choosing where to stay is less about stadium access — you can reach any ground from any central neighborhood — and more about what kind of experience you want.</p>

        <h3>Ciudad Vieja</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> History, nightlife, and the budget-conscious fan. Ciudad Vieja is the oldest neighborhood in Montevideo, centered around Plaza Matriz and the port area. During the day it buzzes with the Mercado del Puerto (the city's iconic food market — more on that below), street art, and colonial architecture. At night, the bars on Bartolome Mitre and surrounding streets come alive. Hostels are cheap (10-15 USD per bed), and the ferry terminal is right here if you are arriving from Buenos Aires. On weekday evenings Ciudad Vieja can feel quiet — stick to the main streets.</p>

        <h3>Pocitos</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The traveling fan who wants a comfortable base with beach vibes. Pocitos is Montevideo's most popular residential beach neighborhood. The Rambla promenade is perfect for a morning run or post-match walk, and the area is full of cafes, restaurants, and shops along Av. Brasil and the streets behind the beach. Safe, well-connected by bus, and a 20-minute walk to the Centenario through Parque Batlle. Mid-range hotels and Airbnbs are plentiful. This is where many visiting fans choose to stay.</p>

        <h3>Punta Carretas</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Safety, quiet, and a touch of elegance. Adjacent to Pocitos, Punta Carretas is one of Montevideo's most upscale neighborhoods. The Rambla section here is beautiful, and the area is home to the Punta Carretas Shopping mall (built inside a former prison — worth seeing for the architecture alone). Slightly more expensive than Pocitos, but equally well-connected and very safe at all hours.</p>

        <h3>Cordon</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The university-area backpacker who wants cheap eats and local bars. Cordon is the student neighborhood, centered around the Universidad de la Republica. It has the highest density of cheap restaurants, pizzerias, and bars in the city. It is also centrally located — walking distance to Ciudad Vieja, the Centro, and Parque Batlle. Accommodation is budget-friendly, and the area has an authentic, non-touristy Montevideo feel.</p>

        <h3>Parque Batlle</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone obsessed with the Centenario. The residential neighborhood around the park is quiet, green, and literally across the street from the stadium. There is not much nightlife, but the location is unbeatable for matchday. You can wake up, walk five minutes, and be standing in front of the Torre de los Homenajes. Several small hotels and guesthouses operate in the area.</p>

If you plan to stay longer than a couple of days, Pocitos offers a better quality of life as a base camp for exploring the city's football scene.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Montevideo is one of the easiest cities in South America to navigate. It is flat, compact, and most of the football-relevant locations are within a reasonable distance of each other. Here is how to get around.</p>

        <h3>Walking</h3>
        <p>This is your primary mode of transport in Montevideo. The city is flat and walkable, and many of the key distances are shorter than you expect. Ciudad Vieja to the Centro: 10 minutes. Pocitos to Parque Batlle (Centenario): 20 minutes. Centro to Gran Parque Central: 25 minutes. Walking is also the best way to experience the Rambla — Montevideo's stunning waterfront promenade that stretches for over 20 kilometers along the coast. On matchday, walking to the Centenario from Pocitos through Parque Batlle is a ritual in itself, joining the growing stream of fans heading to the ground.</p>

        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>Montevideo's bus system is the backbone of public transport. Buses run frequently and cover the entire city. You pay with a STM card (Montevideo's contactless transport card), which you can buy and top up at kiosks, Abitab, and RedPagos outlets throughout the city. A single ride costs around 0.80 USD. The system is reliable but can be confusing for newcomers — use Google Maps or the Como Ir app for routes. Key routes for stadiums: buses along Av. 8 de Octubre and Bulevar Artigas pass near the Centenario and Gran Parque Central; Camino Maldonado buses reach Campeon del Siglo.</p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>Taxis in Montevideo are metered, legal, and relatively cheap. A ride from Ciudad Vieja to the Centenario costs around 5-8 USD. From Pocitos to Campeon del Siglo, around 8-12 USD. Taxis are easy to flag on the street during the day, and you can also call radio taxis. They are a good option for getting to and from matches, especially at night.</p>

        <h3>Uber</h3>
        <p>Uber operates in Montevideo and is widely used. Prices are similar to taxis, sometimes slightly cheaper. It is particularly useful for the return trip from Campeon del Siglo, where taxis can be scarce. Have the app installed and a payment method set up before matchday.</p>

        <h3>From Buenos Aires</h3>
        <p><strong>Buquebus ferry:</strong> The most popular route. Direct fast ferry from Buenos Aires to Montevideo takes about 2 hours 15 minutes (40-120 USD depending on class and booking time). Alternative: ferry to Colonia del Sacramento (1 hour) + bus to Montevideo (2-3 hours) — cheaper and lets you see Colonia, which is a beautiful colonial town worth a stop. <strong>Flights:</strong> Buenos Aires to Montevideo is a 45-minute flight. Budget airlines sometimes offer fares under 50 USD. <strong>Bus:</strong> Direct buses run the full route (8-9 hours including the ferry crossing at Colonia-Buenos Aires, 30-50 USD). Only recommended if you are on a very tight budget.</p>

            STM Card tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Get your STM card as soon as you arrive. You can purchase one at the Tres Cruces bus terminal (if arriving by bus), at Abitab kiosks throughout the city, or at the ferry terminal in Ciudad Vieja. Load it with enough credit for a few days of bus rides — about 5-10 USD will last you several days of regular use. Without the STM card, you cannot board any city bus.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-previa">Food & The Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>Uruguayan pre-match culture is not as chaotic or street-party-oriented as Buenos Aires. It is more intimate, more family-rooted, and centered around food — specifically, around the grill. The Uruguayan asado is a Sunday institution, and when there is a match in the afternoon, the asado becomes the pre-match ritual.</p>

        <h3>Asado</h3>
        <p>The Uruguayan asado is sacred. Entire families and groups of friends gather around the grill (parrilla) hours before the match, cooking cuts of beef, chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes vegetables over wood or charcoal. If you are staying at a hostel, ask if they organize asados — many do, especially on weekends. The Mercado del Puerto in Ciudad Vieja is the most famous place to eat grilled meat in Montevideo: a historic iron market filled with parrilla restaurants where you can sit at the counter and watch the grill master work. It is touristy but genuinely excellent. Go for lunch on a Saturday.</p>

        <h3>Chivito</h3>
        <p>Uruguay's national sandwich and one of the most underrated street foods in South America. A chivito is a steak sandwich loaded with ham, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, olives, and a fried egg — all piled into a bread roll. It is absurdly filling and costs between 4-8 USD at most restaurants. The chivito is the perfect pre-match meal: cheap, massive, and it will keep you fueled through 90 minutes of chanting. Every bar and restaurant in Montevideo serves one.</p>

        <h3>Medio y Medio</h3>
        <p>The classic Montevideo aperitif. Medio y medio is a mix of sparkling white wine and dry white wine, served cold. It originated at the Roldos bar in Ciudad Vieja (still operating) and has been the unofficial drink of Montevideo for over a century. It is light, refreshing, and perfect for a pre-match toast. You will find it at virtually every bar in Ciudad Vieja and the Centro.</p>

        <h3>Mate</h3>
        <p>You cannot talk about Uruguay without talking about mate. The herbal infusion, drunk from a gourd with a metal straw (bombilla), is not just a drink — it is the social glue of Uruguayan society. Uruguayans carry their thermos everywhere: on the bus, at work, at the beach, and absolutely at the stadium. On matchday, fans walk to the ground with mate in hand. If someone offers you mate, accept it — it is a gesture of friendship. You will see more thermoses at a Uruguayan football ground than at any other stadium in the world.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Match Around the Centenario</h3>
        <p>The streets surrounding Parque Batlle on matchday are the heart of the Montevideo pre-match scene. Street vendors set up grills along the main roads, selling choripan and burgers. Fans gather in the park, sharing mate and beers, playing football on the grass, and building the atmosphere hours before kickoff. The area around the main entrance, near the Torre de los Homenajes, is where the crowd is thickest. The energy builds slowly and steadily — this is not Buenos Aires' explosion of fireworks and smoke, but a warm, communal gathering that feels like a neighborhood barbecue that just happens to precede 60,000 people roaring inside a stadium.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Match Around Gran Parque Central</h3>
        <p>Nacional's home ground is in a more residential area, and the pre-match scene here is more bar-focused. The bars along the surrounding streets fill up with Nacional fans in red, white, and blue. It is smaller-scale than the Centenario, but more intimate — you are drinking alongside the same people who will be standing next to you on the terraces. Ask the locals which bar to go to — they will be happy to adopt a visiting fan.</p>

        <h2 id="budget">Estimated Budget</h2>

        <p>Montevideo is an affordable destination for football tourism. Uruguay is not as cheap as Bolivia or Paraguay, but compared to Brazil, Chile, or Europe, your money goes a long way — especially if you are carrying dollars or euros. Here are approximate costs in USD.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Montevideo is one of the safest capitals in South America for tourists. It does not have the petty crime levels of Buenos Aires, Rio, or Lima, and the football culture, while intense, is not as volatile as in Argentina or Brazil. That said, common sense applies everywhere. Here are the rules for the traveling fan.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival colors near a stadium.</strong> This is universal in South American football, and Montevideo is no exception. If you are going to a Nacional match, do not wear anything gold or black (Peñarol colors), and vice versa. Keep your team colors in your bag until you are safely inside the ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Ciudad Vieja at night:</strong> The old town is lively on weekends but can feel deserted on weekday evenings. Stick to well-lit streets around Plaza Matriz and the bar district on Bartolome Mitre. The port area can be sketchy after dark — avoid walking there alone late at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Phone awareness:</strong> Phone snatching occurs, particularly in crowded areas and on buses. Keep your phone in your front pocket or inside your jacket. Do not walk while scrolling on the street, especially near bus stops.</li>
          <li><strong>Post-match transport:</strong> After night matches, use taxis or Uber to get back to your accommodation. The areas around stadiums empty out quickly after the final whistle, and walking alone through quiet streets at night is not recommended.</li>
          <li><strong>Clasico day:</strong> On the day of Nacional vs Peñarol, the city's tension level rises noticeably. Avoid wearing any football colors in public transport, steer clear of groups of ultras (barras bravas), and follow the crowd flow around the stadium rather than exploring on your own. The police presence on Clasico day is heavy, and the match itself is well-controlled inside the ground — just exercise common sense outside.</li>
          <li><strong>Carry a copy of your passport.</strong> Leave the original at your accommodation. You may need ID to purchase match tickets or to enter the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Beach safety:</strong> The Rambla and Pocitos beach are safe during the day and early evening. Avoid the beach areas late at night, especially alone. Parque Rodo can have isolated incidents after dark.</li>

            About barras bravas
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Like most South American countries, Uruguay has organized fan groups (barras bravas) associated with the major clubs. These groups control the popular sections (terraces) of the stadiums and can be territorial. As a visiting fan or tourist, avoid the sections immediately behind the goals (the popular sections) unless you are comfortable in a standing, densely packed, intensely passionate environment. The side stands (platea) and upper tiers offer a safer and more comfortable matchday experience while still providing a fantastic atmosphere.</p>

                For most Uruguayan Primera Division matches, tickets are sold at the stadium box office on matchday, starting a few hours before kickoff. For high-demand matches — especially the Clasico between Nacional and Peñarol — tickets sell out fast, and you may need to purchase through the home club's official website or authorized resellers. Some clubs also sell tickets at RedPagos and Abitab outlets across the city. Prices for regular league matches range from 8 to 25 USD. Never buy from street resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets are a known issue during big matches.

                Montevideo is generally one of the safest capital cities in South America for tourists. The central areas (Ciudad Vieja, Pocitos, Punta Carretas, Cordon) are walkable and well-policed during the day. On matchday, take standard precautions: do not wear a rival team's jersey near the stadium, keep valuables hidden, and use taxis or ride-hailing apps to return from night matches. The area around Estadio Centenario (Parque Batlle) is residential and calm. Ciudad Vieja can feel quieter after dark on weekdays, so stick to main streets at night.

                Yes. Estadio Centenario houses the Museo del Futbol (Football Museum), which is open on weekdays and some Saturdays. The museum covers the history of the 1930 World Cup, Uruguayan football's golden era, and features memorabilia from both Nacional and Peñarol. Guided stadium tours are available and give access to the pitch, changing rooms, and the iconic Torre de los Homenajes (Tower of Tributes). It is a must-visit for any football fan, even without a match.

                The most popular option is the Buquebus ferry, which crosses the Rio de la Plata from Buenos Aires to Montevideo (or via Colonia del Sacramento). The direct fast ferry takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes, while the route via Colonia takes about 1 hour by ferry plus 2-3 hours by bus. Buquebus prices vary from 40 to 120 USD depending on the class and how far in advance you book. You can also fly — the Buenos Aires-Montevideo route is short (45 minutes), and budget airlines sometimes offer fares under 50 USD. Bus services also run between the two cities (8-9 hours, 30-50 USD).

                The Uruguayan Primera Division runs roughly from February to December, with a short winter break in July. The best months for football travel are March to May (autumn — pleasant weather, league fully underway) and September to November (spring — weather warming up, playoff races heating up). Summer (December-February) is holiday season, and many matches are rescheduled or lower in attendance. If you want the Clasico, check the fixture schedule in advance — Nacional vs Peñarol is typically played 2-3 times per season across different competitions.
