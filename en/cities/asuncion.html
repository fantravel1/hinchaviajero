Prices for regular league matches range from 5 to 15 USD.

On matchday, arrive at the stadium early, stick to well-lit and populated streets, and use taxis or ride-hailing apps to return from night matches. Avoid wearing rival colors near any stadium. The areas around Defensores del Chaco and La Nueva Olla have heavy police presence on matchday but can be quieter after the final whistle. Keep valuables hidden and avoid displaying expensive phones on the street."

Winters (June-August) are milder, with temperatures between 15-25C (59-77F) — the most comfortable season for attending football. Rain can hit suddenly year-round, so a light rain jacket is always advisable. The Paraguayan league runs from February to December."

Tickets for the Superclasico paraguayo are sold through the home club's channels and at the stadium, though they sell out faster than regular matches. The match is usually played at the home team's ground (La Nueva Olla for Cerro, or Manuel Ferreira for Olimpia), and sometimes at Defensores del Chaco for special occasions. Unlike Argentina, Paraguay does allow visiting fans in most matches, though the away section is heavily policed and separated. Arrive very early on Superclasico day — the atmosphere outside the stadium starts 3-4 hours before kickoff."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY ASUNCION ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-asuncion">Why Asuncion?</h2>

        <p>Asuncion is the hidden gem of South American football tourism. While Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, and Bogota dominate the conversation, Paraguay's capital quietly offers something increasingly rare on the continent: a football culture that has not been sanitized, corporatized, or packaged for tourists. What you get in Asuncion is the real thing — raw, loud, hot, and utterly authentic.</p>

        <p>This is a city where football is the beating heart of social life. Three major clubs — Olimpia, Cerro Porteno, and Libertad — share the same metropolitan area, and the rivalries between them are deep, personal, and woven into the fabric of family identity. You do not choose your club in Asuncion. You inherit it. You are born Franjeado (Olimpia), Azulgrana (Cerro), or Gumarelo (Libertad), and that identity stays with you for life. It shapes your friendships, your neighborhood, even your political loyalties.</p>

        <p>Olimpia is the most decorated Paraguayan club and the only one to have won the Copa Libertadores — South America's most prestigious club competition. Cerro Porteno is the most popular club in the country, with the largest fanbase and the most passionate supporters. Libertad, the youngest of the three, has dominated domestically in recent decades and plays a sophisticated, tactical brand of football. Together, these three clubs create a footballing ecosystem that keeps the entire city in a permanent state of competitive tension.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Asuncion, football is not consumed from a screen. It is lived on the street, in the heat, with terere in one hand and a radio in the other. The stands sing in Guarani. The choripan comes with mandioca. The passion is unfiltered, unsponsored, and absolutely real. This is what South American football felt like before the money arrived."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For the traveling fan, Asuncion offers something else that matters enormously: affordability. This is one of the cheapest football destinations on the continent. Match tickets cost between 5 and 15 USD. A meal near the stadium is 2-5 USD. A hostel bed is 6-12 USD per night. You can live a full matchday experience — transport, food, ticket, beer — for less than 25 USD. In a world where attending a Premier League match costs more than a flight to South America, Asuncion is a reminder that football was born as the people's game.</p>

        <p>The climate is the one variable that requires preparation. Asuncion sits in the subtropical zone, and summers (December to March) are brutally hot and humid — regularly exceeding 35 degrees Celsius with oppressive humidity. Even night matches can be uncomfortable. But the heat is part of the experience. It is part of why the fans drink terere (cold mate) instead of hot mate. It is part of why the atmosphere in the stands has a particular energy — a sweaty, relentless, almost feverish intensity that cooler climates simply cannot produce.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Asuncion has four stadiums that every visiting fan should know. They range from the national team's ground to the intimate home of a domestic giant, and each offers a different slice of Paraguayan football.</p>

        <!-- Defensores del Chaco -->
        <h3 id="defensores-del-chaco">Defensores del Chaco — The National Stadium</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~42,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Sajonia, Asuncion<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1917 (renovated multiple times)</p>

        <p>Defensores del Chaco is the temple of Paraguayan football. Named after the soldiers who defended the Chaco region in the devastating Chaco War (1932-1935), this stadium is where the Paraguayan national team plays its home World Cup qualifiers and where the biggest club matches — including Copa Libertadores knockout rounds and select Superclasico editions — are staged. It is not the most modern stadium on the continent, but what it lacks in polish it compensates with history and atmosphere.</p>

        <p>The ground sits in the Sajonia neighborhood, a historic area near the Paraguay River. On international matchdays, the entire surrounding district transforms. Street vendors set up grills and food stalls for blocks in every direction. Fans arrive hours early, flags flying from car windows, horns blaring, the energy building steadily in the tropical heat. When Paraguay plays a World Cup qualifier here — especially against Argentina or Brazil — the atmosphere inside the ground is genuinely hostile. Visiting teams historically struggle in Asuncion, and the heat, the noise, and the relentless chanting from the Paraguayan fans are a significant part of the reason.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Located in Sajonia, a short taxi or bus ride from the city center. Multiple bus lines run along Avenida Artigas and the surrounding streets. From Villa Morra or the Centro, a taxi costs approximately 3-5 USD. On matchday, traffic around the stadium can be very heavy, so arrive early or walk the final stretch.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are in Asuncion during World Cup qualifiers, attending a Paraguay home match at Defensores del Chaco should be your top priority. The national team atmosphere here is extraordinary — the entire city rallies behind the Albirroja, and the combination of heat, noise, and Guarani chants creates an environment that rivals any national team ground in South America. Tickets for qualifiers are available through the APF website and at the stadium, but sell out fast for matches against Argentina and Brazil.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- La Nueva Olla -->
        <h3 id="la-nueva-olla">La Nueva Olla — Cerro Porteno</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~45,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Barrio Obrero, Asuncion<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 2017 (new version)</p>

        <p>La Nueva Olla is the largest club-owned stadium in Paraguay and the home of Cerro Porteno — the most popular club in the country. The stadium was completely rebuilt and reopened in 2017, replacing the old Estadio General Pablo Rojas with a modern, steep-sided bowl that generates enormous noise. When Cerro play at home, the Azulgrana faithful pack the ground and produce an atmosphere that has earned La Nueva Olla a reputation as one of the most intimidating venues in South American club football.</p>

        <p>Cerro Porteno is the club of the people. Founded in 1912 in the working-class Barrio Obrero neighborhood — where the stadium still stands — the club's identity is rooted in popular culture, in the streets, in the everyday life of Asuncion's working class. Their red and blue colors are everywhere in the city: on walls, on taxis, on market stalls. The club has the largest registered membership in Paraguay, and their barra brava (the Azulgrana organized fan group) is one of the most visually and sonically spectacular on the continent. The tifo displays at La Nueva Olla — massive banners, confetti, smoke — are genuinely world-class.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Located in Barrio Obrero, south of the city center. Buses along Avenida Eusebio Ayala and surrounding routes pass near the stadium. From the Centro, it is a 15-20 minute bus ride or a 5-8 USD taxi ride. On matchday, the streets around Barrio Obrero fill up with vendors and fans well before kickoff — follow the crowd and the smell of grilled meat.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Barrio Obrero is a working-class neighborhood with deep Cerro Porteno identity. Do not wear Olimpia or Libertad colors anywhere near the stadium or the surrounding streets. Arrive early (2+ hours before kickoff) to enjoy the pre-match atmosphere safely. After night matches, take a taxi or Uber directly from the stadium area — do not walk through the neighborhood alone after dark.</p>

        <!-- Manuel Ferreira -->
        <h3 id="manuel-ferreira">Estadio Manuel Ferreira — Olimpia</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~18,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Barrio Republicano, Asuncion<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1928</p>

        <p>Estadio Manuel Ferreira, known affectionately as "La Olla" (The Pot), is the home of Club Olimpia — the most decorated club in Paraguayan football history and the only Paraguayan club to have won the Copa Libertadores (1979, 1990, 2002). The stadium is named after Manuel Ferreira, a legendary Olimpia player and administrator, and sits in the Barrio Republicano area, relatively close to the city center.</p>

        <p>Olimpia is Paraguayan football royalty. Founded in 1902, they are the oldest club in the country and have won more league titles than any other. Their fans — los Franjeados, named after the club's distinctive black-and-white striped jersey — consider themselves the aristocracy of Paraguayan football, and the rivalry with Cerro Porteno is built on that foundational tension: the historical elite versus the popular mass. Manuel Ferreira is a compact, atmospheric ground where the proximity of the stands to the pitch creates an intimacy that larger stadiums cannot match. When 18,000 Olimpia fans pack this ground for a Libertadores night, the noise is disproportionate to the capacity.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Centrally located in Barrio Republicano. Easy to reach by bus from anywhere in the city, and walking distance from the Centro. A taxi from Villa Morra costs around 3-4 USD. The surrounding streets have bars and food stalls that activate on matchday.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">If you are a football history enthusiast, visiting Manuel Ferreira is a pilgrimage. This is where Olimpia — a club from a country of 7 million people — built the foundation for three Libertadores titles, competing against the giants of Argentina and Brazil. The ground may be modest in size, but the weight of its history is immense. Try to attend a Copa Libertadores group stage match here for the full experience.</p>

        <!-- Nicolas Leoz -->
        <h3 id="nicolas-leoz">Estadio Nicolas Leoz — Libertad</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~12,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Barrio Mburicao, Asuncion<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1989</p>

        <p>Estadio Nicolas Leoz is the home of Club Libertad, the third force of Asuncion football. Named after the controversial former CONMEBOL president who was closely associated with the club, the stadium is the most intimate of Asuncion's four major grounds. With a capacity of approximately 12,000, it offers a close-quarters football experience where every chant, every tactical instruction from the bench, and every thud of the ball is audible from any seat.</p>

        <p>Libertad is the youngest of the big three, founded in 1905, but has been the dominant force in Paraguayan domestic football in the 21st century, racking up league titles at a remarkable rate. They play a disciplined, organized brand of football — the tactical opposite of the more chaotic, emotionally driven approach of Cerro Porteno. Their fans, los Gumarelos, are passionate but less numerous than Olimpia's or Cerro's, which makes the atmosphere at Nicolas Leoz more concentrated and intense per capita. The small ground amplifies everything.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Located in the Mburicao neighborhood, accessible by bus along the main avenues. From Villa Morra, a taxi costs approximately 2-4 USD. The surrounding area is residential and calm, making pre-match walks easy and safe during daylight hours.</p>

        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Asuncion's footballing rivalries are among the most intense and least commercially exploited in South America. These are matches driven by genuine, generational hatred and love — not by television contracts or marketing campaigns.</p>

        <!-- El Superclasico -->
        <h3 id="superclasico">Olimpia vs Cerro Porteno — El Superclasico</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 78/100</strong></p>

        <p>The Superclasico paraguayo. Olimpia versus Cerro Porteno. This is the match that divides Asuncion in half. Every family, every workplace, every neighborhood bar splits along this fault line. The rivalry goes beyond football: it is a clash of identities. Olimpia, the historical aristocrat, the Libertadores champion, the club of tradition and titles. Cerro Porteno, the people's club, the most popular, the club of the barrio, of the street, of the working class. Those narratives, like all great derby narratives, are simplified versions of a more complex reality — but they fuel the fire all the same.</p>

        <p>On Superclasico day, the city stops. Shops close early. Taxis fly Olimpia or Cerro flags from their windows. The radio is a non-stop stream of pre-match analysis in both Spanish and Guarani. The stadium — whichever ground hosts the match — fills hours before kickoff, with the organized fan groups (barras) preparing their displays: flags the size of buildings, torrents of confetti, coordinated chanting that shakes the concrete. The actual match is almost secondary to the spectacle.</p>

        <p>What makes the Superclasico paraguayo special for the visiting fan is its accessibility. Unlike the Argentine Superclasico (Boca vs River), which requires club membership, connections, or expensive tourism packages, the Paraguayan version is still relatively easy to attend. Tickets are sold through normal channels, prices remain affordable (10-20 USD), and the atmosphere is absolutely genuine. This is one of the best-value derby experiences in all of South American football.</p>

Arrive at the stadium at least 3 hours before kickoff to get through the security checks and enjoy the pre-match buildup. After the match, leave immediately by taxi or Uber. Do not linger around the stadium. Police presence is heavy but incidents between fan groups can occur in the streets after the final whistle. Avoid wearing any football colors on public transport on Superclasico day.</p>

          <li><strong>Olimpia vs Libertad:</strong> A clash between the historical giant and the modern domestic powerhouse. Less emotionally charged than the Superclasico, but tactically fascinating and always competitive.</li>
          <li><strong>Cerro Porteno vs Libertad:</strong> Cerro's massive fanbase against Libertad's organized discipline. The contrast in styles — Cerro's passion-driven chaos versus Libertad's clinical approach — makes for compelling football.</li>
          <li><strong>Guarani vs Sol de America:</strong> The "other" Asuncion derby, featuring two clubs from outside the big three.

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOTBALL CULTURE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="football-culture">Football Culture: What Makes Asuncion Different</h2>

        <p>Asuncion's football culture has characteristics that set it apart from every other city on the continent. Understanding these cultural elements will transform your matchday experience from mere observation to genuine participation.</p>

        <h3>Guarani Chants</h3>
        <p>Paraguay is the only country in South America where an indigenous language — Guarani — is spoken by the majority of the population alongside Spanish. This bilingualism flows directly into football culture. Many of the most iconic terrace chants in Asuncion are sung entirely or partially in Guarani. The effect is extraordinary: a wall of sound in a language that predates European colonization, channeled through a sport that arrived from England, in a stadium built with Paraguayan concrete. It is a cultural fusion that exists nowhere else in world football. Even if you do not understand the words, the rhythm and emotion of Guarani chants are unmistakable.</p>

        <h3>Terere in the Stands</h3>
        <p>In Argentina and Uruguay, fans drink mate (hot). In Paraguay, the drink is terere — cold mate, made with ice-cold water and often infused with medicinal herbs (yuyos). In the subtropical heat of Asuncion, terere is not a preference: it is a survival necessity. Fans bring their terere equipment to the stadium — the guampa (cup), the bombilla (metal straw), the thermos of cold water, the bag of yerba — and share it with friends and strangers throughout the match. Being offered terere in the stands is a gesture of friendship and inclusion. Accept it. It is one of the most authentic human interactions you will have at a football match anywhere in the world.</p>

        <h3>The Heat Factor</h3>
        <p>Asuncion's subtropical climate is not a backdrop — it is an active participant in every match. Summer matches are played in temperatures that would cause postponements in Europe. Players, fans, and referees all operate in conditions that demand physical and mental endurance. The heat affects the pace of play (Paraguayan football tends to be more physical and direct, partly because the climate punishes excessive running), and it shapes the matchday culture. Fans bring umbrellas for sun protection, wear light clothing, and consume enormous quantities of terere and cold water. If you are coming from a temperate climate, the heat at a summer daytime match can be genuinely challenging. Hydrate relentlessly.</p>

        <h3>The Primera Division</h3>
        <p>Paraguay's top flight is the Primera Division, run by the Asociacion Paraguaya de Futbol (APF). The league features 12 teams, with most of the major clubs based in the Greater Asuncion metropolitan area. The season runs from February to December, with two short tournaments per year (Apertura and Clausura). The quality of play is competitive — Paraguay has consistently produced world-class players (Chilavert, Roque Santa Cruz, Oscar Romero, Miguel Almiron) and its clubs regularly compete in the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana. What the league lacks in the financial firepower of Argentina or Brazil, it compensates with tactical intensity and physical commitment.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Asuncion is a spread-out city without a metro system, so your choice of neighborhood matters for both convenience and safety. These are the best bases for the traveling football fan.</p>

        <h3>Centro (Downtown)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The budget-conscious fan who wants to be close to everything. The Centro historico is the oldest part of Asuncion, centered around the Palacio de los Lopez (the presidential palace) and the area near the bay. It has the cheapest accommodation in the city, including several hostels and budget hotels in the 6-12 USD range per night. The Centro is within walking distance of Manuel Ferreira (Olimpia) and a short bus ride from the other stadiums. During the day it is busy and relatively safe; at night, some streets can feel deserted, so stick to well-lit areas and use taxis after dark.</p>

        <h3>Villa Morra</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The traveling fan who wants comfort, safety, and nightlife. Villa Morra is Asuncion's most modern and cosmopolitan neighborhood — the equivalent of Palermo in Buenos Aires or Miraflores in Lima. Shopping centers, international restaurants, bars, and the best hotel and Airbnb options in the city are concentrated here. It is well-connected by bus to all stadiums, and taxis from Villa Morra to any ground in the city cost 3-8 USD. This is the default recommendation for first-time visitors.</p>

        <h3>Sajonia</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone prioritizing proximity to Defensores del Chaco. The Sajonia neighborhood sits right next to the national stadium and has a historic, slightly rough-around-the-edges charm. The area along the river has been partially revitalized, and there are some interesting cultural spots nearby. Accommodation options are limited but affordable. On matchday at Defensores del Chaco, you can walk to the stadium from your hostel in minutes. The area is safe during the day but requires more caution at night.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Banado Norte and Banado Sur areas (informal settlements along the river) should be avoided by tourists. Some streets in the Centro and around the bus terminal can feel unsafe after dark. Barrio Obrero (Cerro Porteno's neighborhood) is fine on matchday when crowds and police are present, but is not recommended for solo exploration at night. As a general rule in Asuncion: use taxis or Uber after dark, keep valuables hidden, and stay in well-populated areas.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Asuncion does not have a metro or modern mass transit system. Getting around requires a combination of buses, taxis, and ride-hailing apps. The city is spread out, but the distances between football-relevant locations are manageable.</p>

        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>Asuncion's bus system is extensive but can be confusing for newcomers. Buses are cheap (around 0.50 USD per ride) and run frequently along the main avenues. The system does not have a centralized app or route planner that works reliably, so Google Maps is your best friend for figuring out which bus to take. Buses can be crowded during peak hours, and the vehicles range from modern to extremely old. On matchday, buses along the routes near stadiums fill up fast, so leave early or use alternative transport. Keep your belongings close and your phone out of sight on buses.</p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>Taxis are plentiful, metered, and affordable in Asuncion. A ride across the city rarely exceeds 5-8 USD. Taxis are easy to flag on the street during the day. At night and after matches, calling a radio taxi or using an app is more reliable. Most taxi drivers are friendly and many are football fans — asking them about the local football scene is a great way to get insider recommendations. Agree on the fare or confirm the meter is running before departing.</p>

        <h3>Uber / Bolt</h3>
        <p>Uber and Bolt both operate in Asuncion and are widely used. Prices are slightly cheaper than taxis, and the apps give you the security of GPS-tracked rides and digital payment. For getting back from the stadium at night, ride-hailing apps are your best option. Have the app installed and a payment method set up before matchday. Surge pricing applies after big matches when everyone is trying to leave at the same time — be patient or start walking toward a main avenue where it is easier to get a ride.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport</h3>
        <p><strong>Silvio Pettirossi International Airport (ASU)</strong> is located approximately 15 kilometers from the city center in the Luque municipality. Options: taxi (fixed fare, approximately 20-25 USD to the Centro or Villa Morra), Uber/Bolt (15-20 USD, though availability can vary), or bus (cheap but slow and not recommended with luggage). The airport is modern and well-organized. If you are arriving for a specific match, check the fixture schedule — Luque is also home to the APF headquarters and several training facilities.</p>

        <h3>Getting to Asuncion</h3>
        <p><strong>By air:</strong> Direct flights connect Asuncion to Buenos Aires (1h45m), Sao Paulo (2h), Lima, Santiago, and Bogota. LATAM, Amaszonas, and Flybondi operate the main routes. <strong>By bus:</strong> Long-distance buses from Buenos Aires (16-18 hours, 40-70 USD), Ciudad del Este (4-5 hours, 10-15 USD), and Brazilian cities. The Terminal de Omnibus de Asuncion is centrally located. <strong>From Argentina:</strong> The border crossing at Clorinda (Argentina) to Asuncion is a common overland route — buses and taxis cross the international bridge regularly.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Download Uber and Bolt before arriving in Asuncion. Having both apps gives you more options and better pricing on matchday. For buses, Google Maps generally provides accurate route information, though real-time arrival data can be unreliable. When in doubt, ask a local — Asuncenos are friendly and accustomed to helping visitors navigate the city.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-previa">Food & The Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>The pre-match culture in Asuncion is centered around two things: grilled meat and terere. It is less organized than Buenos Aires' choreographed previas, but more genuine — a neighborhood gathering that builds naturally as matchday approaches.</p>

        <h3>Chipa</h3>
        <p>Paraguay's iconic bread, made from mandioca (cassava) starch and cheese. Chipa comes in various shapes — ring-shaped, oval, small balls — and is eaten at every meal and every snack time. On matchday, chipa vendors are ubiquitous near stadiums, selling bags of fresh, warm chipa for less than a dollar. It is filling, cheap, and pairs perfectly with terere. You will also find chipa on buses, at traffic lights, and in every corner store. It is the single most consumed food item in Paraguay, and for good reason — it is delicious.</p>

        <h3>Sopa Paraguaya</h3>
        <p>Despite the name, sopa paraguaya is not a soup at all — it is a thick, savory cornbread made with corn flour, cheese, onions, eggs, and milk. It is uniquely Paraguayan and has no equivalent in any neighboring country's cuisine. You will find it at pre-match food stalls, at restaurants, and at family gatherings before the match. A slice of sopa paraguaya with a cold beer is a classic Paraguayan pre-match combination. It is substantial enough to keep you fueled through 90 minutes of chanting in the heat.</p>

        <h3>Asado</h3>
        <p>Like Argentina and Uruguay, Paraguay has a deep asado (barbecue) culture. The Paraguayan version tends to feature more mandioca alongside the grilled meats, and the cuts of beef are different from the Argentine pampa cattle — slightly leaner, slightly tougher, but full of flavor. Near stadiums, mobile grill vendors sell choripan (chorizo in bread), costillas (ribs), and beef served with mandioca. A full plate of grilled meat with mandioca and salad costs 3-5 USD from a street stall. The quality varies — look for the stall with the biggest queue.</p>

        <h3>Terere</h3>
        <p>Terere is not just a drink in Paraguay — it is a social institution. Made by pouring ice-cold water over yerba mate in a guampa (a cup traditionally made from a hollowed-out bull's horn, though modern versions are often wooden or metal), terere is shared communally. One person prepares and serves (the cebador), and the guampa is passed around the group, each person drinking through the bombilla and handing it back for a refill. On matchday, terere circles form everywhere: in front of the stadium, on the bus, in the stands during the match. Many fans add medicinal herbs (yuyos) to the cold water for flavor and supposed health benefits. If someone in the stands offers you a sip, accept it — this is Paraguayan hospitality at its most fundamental.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Match Around the Stadiums</h3>
        <p>The pre-match scene in Asuncion starts 2-3 hours before kickoff. Around La Nueva Olla (Cerro Porteno), the streets of Barrio Obrero transform into a massive, sprawling street party: smoke from dozens of grills, music blasting from speakers, Cerro flags hanging from every window and balcony, and the constant sound of chanting building in intensity as kickoff approaches. Around Manuel Ferreira (Olimpia), the atmosphere is more contained but no less passionate — the smaller ground means the pre-match crowd is concentrated into a tighter area, giving it an intimate, neighborhood feel. At Defensores del Chaco, the pre-match scene has a more neutral, national flavor, attracting fans of all clubs when the national team plays.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Buy your own terere equipment in Asuncion — a guampa, bombilla, and bag of yerba mate can be purchased at any market for 5-10 USD total. Bringing your own terere to the stadium is the single best way to connect with local fans. Paraguayans are genuinely delighted when they see a foreigner participating in terere culture, and it will open doors to conversations, friendships, and insider matchday tips that no guidebook can provide.</p>

ATMs are available in Villa Morra, the Centro, and shopping centers. Exchange houses (casas de cambio) on Calle Palma in the Centro offer competitive rates. Credit cards are accepted at hotels and restaurants in Villa Morra but not widely at street stalls or small shops. Always carry cash on matchday.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Asuncion is a moderately safe city by South American standards — safer than many Brazilian cities, comparable to Lima, and slightly less safe than Montevideo or Santiago. For the traveling football fan, the standard precautions apply, with a few local specifics.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival colors near any stadium.</strong> This is non-negotiable in Asuncion. If you are going to a Cerro Porteno match, do not wear black and white (Olimpia). If you are heading to Olimpia, do not wear red and blue (Cerro). The neighborhoods around the stadiums have strong club identities, and wearing the wrong colors is seen as a provocation.</li>
          <li><strong>Use taxis or Uber after night matches.</strong> The areas around stadiums can empty quickly after the final whistle, and walking alone through poorly lit streets at night is not recommended. Have your Uber or Bolt app ready, or arrange a taxi in advance.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your phone hidden on buses and in crowded areas.</strong> Phone theft (arrebato — snatch and grab) is the most common crime affecting tourists in Asuncion. Do not use your phone while walking on the street or standing at a bus stop. Keep it in your front pocket or inside your bag.</li>
          <li><strong>The Centro at night requires caution.</strong> Downtown Asuncion is busy during the day but can feel deserted and sketchy after dark, especially around the bus terminal and the riverside areas. If your accommodation is in the Centro, return by taxi after nightfall.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> This is a safety issue, not just a comfort one. Dehydration and heat stroke are real risks at summer matches in Asuncion. Bring water, drink terere, wear a hat, and apply sunscreen. If you start feeling dizzy or nauseous during a match, move to a shaded area immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Carry a photocopy of your passport.</strong> Leave the original at your accommodation. You may need ID to purchase match tickets. Some stadiums require ID for entry, especially for international matches.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect the barras bravas.</strong> Like all South American countries, Paraguay has organized fan groups associated with each club. These groups control the popular sections (general standing areas) of the stadiums. As a visiting fan or tourist, the plateas (seated sections) are the safest and most comfortable choice. Do not enter the popular section unless you are with local fans who can vouch for you.</li>
        </ul>

            About visiting fans in Paraguay
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Unlike Argentina, Paraguay generally does allow visiting fans at league matches, with a designated away section that is heavily policed and physically separated from the home fans. If you want to sit in the visiting section, you need to purchase tickets through the visiting club's channels. However, for the Superclasico and other high-tension matches, visiting fan policies can change at short notice. Check the APF website and local news before assuming visiting fans are allowed for your specific match.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: CLIMATE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="climate">Climate & Best Time to Visit</h2>

        <p>Climate is a critical factor when planning a football trip to Asuncion. The city's subtropical location means extreme heat in summer and mild, pleasant conditions in winter. Your matchday experience will vary dramatically depending on the season.</p>

        <h3>Summer (December — March)</h3>
        <p>Hot. Very hot. Temperatures regularly exceed 35°C (95°F) with high humidity, making it feel even hotter. Daytime matches are brutal — bring water, sunscreen, and a hat. Evening matches (usually kicking off at 19:00 or 20:30) are more bearable but still warm. Sudden thunderstorms can hit in the afternoon, sometimes causing match delays. This is the most challenging season for visiting fans from temperate climates, but the atmospheric intensity is at its peak.</p>

        <h3>Autumn (April — May)</h3>
        <p>The sweet spot. Temperatures drop to a more comfortable 20-28°C (68-82°F), humidity decreases, and the rain becomes less frequent. The league is well underway, and the Libertadores group stage is in full swing. This is the best time to visit Asuncion for football if you want to maximize comfort without sacrificing atmosphere.</p>

        <h3>Winter (June — August)</h3>
        <p>Mild and pleasant by subtropical standards — 15-25°C (59-77°F) during the day, dropping to 8-12°C (46-54°F) on cooler nights. You may need a jacket for evening matches. The city feels less intense, the pace of life slows slightly, and the football takes on a different character — less frenetic, more technical. A good season for fans who do not handle heat well.</p>

        <h3>Spring (September — November)</h3>
        <p>Temperatures rise again, and the league enters its decisive phase — playoff races, relegation battles, and Libertadores knockout rounds create maximum tension. The weather is warm but not as extreme as summer. September and October are excellent months for a football trip: competitive stakes are high, the weather is tolerable, and the pre-match atmosphere reflects the end-of-season urgency.</p>

                For most Primera Division matches in Asuncion, tickets are sold at the stadium box office (boleteria) on matchday, starting 2-3 hours before kickoff. For high-demand matches like the Superclasico (Olimpia vs Cerro Porteno), tickets sell out fast and you should try the club's official website or authorized points of sale around the city. Prices for regular league matches range from 5 to 15 USD. For Libertadores or international matches at Defensores del Chaco, tickets are available through the APF (Paraguayan Football Association) website or at the stadium. Never buy from street resellers — counterfeit tickets exist, especially for big matches.

                Asuncion is generally safe for tourists who take standard precautions. The central areas (Centro, Villa Morra, Sajonia) are walkable during the day. On matchday, arrive at the stadium early, stick to well-lit and populated streets, and use taxis or ride-hailing apps to return from night matches. Avoid wearing rival colors near any stadium. The areas around Defensores del Chaco and La Nueva Olla have heavy police presence on matchday but can be quieter after the final whistle. Keep valuables hidden and avoid displaying expensive phones on the street.

                Asuncion has a hot subtropical climate. Summers (December-March) are extremely hot and humid, with temperatures regularly exceeding 35C (95F). Even evening matches can be sweltering. Bring plenty of water, wear light clothing, sunscreen, and a hat for daytime matches. Winters (June-August) are milder, with temperatures between 15-25C (59-77F) — the most comfortable season for attending football. Rain can hit suddenly year-round, so a light rain jacket is always advisable. The Paraguayan league runs from February to December.

                Yes, and it is significantly more accessible than the Argentine Superclasico. Tickets for the Superclasico paraguayo are sold through the home club's channels and at the stadium, though they sell out faster than regular matches. The match is usually played at the home team's ground (La Nueva Olla for Cerro, or Manuel Ferreira for Olimpia), and sometimes at Defensores del Chaco for special occasions. Unlike Argentina, Paraguay does allow visiting fans in most matches, though the away section is heavily policed and separated. Arrive very early on Superclasico day — the atmosphere outside the stadium starts 3-4 hours before kickoff.

By bus: Long-distance buses connect Asuncion to Buenos Aires (16-18 hours, 40-70 USD), Ciudad del Este (4-5 hours), and Brazilian cities via Ciudad del Este. The Asuncion bus terminal is centrally located. By land from Argentina: You can cross from Clorinda (Argentina) to Asuncion via the international bridge — a common route for fans traveling overland from northern Argentina.
