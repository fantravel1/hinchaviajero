For regular Liga BetPlay matches, tickets are usually available on the day of the match, but for the Clasico Paisa and Copa Libertadores fixtures, buying in advance is essential as they sell out fast. Prices range from 8 to 25 USD depending on the section. Bring your passport or a valid ID — it is required for entry. Avoid purchasing from resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets are a known problem."

The Clasico Paisa between Atletico Nacional and DIM is the most intense football experience in Medellin, but it is generally safe for foreign visitors who follow basic rules. Do not wear the colors of one team in the other team's section. Pick a side, buy a ticket in their section, and commit. Arrive early and leave promptly after the final whistle. Use ride-hailing apps or taxis after the match rather than walking through crowded streets. The police presence around the Atanasio Girardot is heavy on derby day. If you are a neutral, the Occidental stand offers a good view and a slightly less intense atmosphere compared to the barras behind the goals."

Medellin is known as the city of eternal spring — temperatures hover between 22 and 28 degrees Celsius year-round at 1,495 meters altitude.

A comfortable mid-range budget of 60 to 110 USD per day gets you a decent hotel, sit-down restaurants, taxis, and better stadium seats. A bandeja paisa at a neighborhood restaurant costs 4-8 USD, empanadas are under 1 USD each, and a bottle of aguardiente from a liquor store runs 5-10 USD. The Colombian peso offers outstanding value."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY MEDELLIN ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-medellin">Why Medellin?</h2>

        <p>Medellin is the football soul of Colombia. While Bogota may have the political capital and the history of the Clasico Capitalino, Medellin has Atletico Nacional — the most titled club in the country — and a footballing intensity that no other Colombian city can match. The Aburra Valley, where Medellin sits nestled between green mountains at 1,495 meters above sea level, produces a microclimate of eternal spring that makes it one of the most pleasant places in South America to watch football. The temperature hovers around 22-28 degrees Celsius year-round. No altitude sickness. No freezing night matches. Just perfect conditions for the beautiful game.</p>

        <p>What sets Medellin apart is the sheer concentration of passion per square meter. Atletico Nacional and Deportivo Independiente Medellin (universally known as DIM or Medellin) share the Estadio Atanasio Girardot, and their rivalry — the Clasico Paisa — is one of the most explosive derbies in all of South America. Nacional, with their record number of league titles and two Copa Libertadores trophies, is the undisputed giant. But DIM, with their deep roots in the working-class neighborhoods and a fanbase that wears red with fierce pride, refuses to live in Nacional's shadow. The tension between these two clubs is not just sporting — it is cultural, social, and deeply personal. Families are divided. Friendships are tested. Entire neighborhoods declare allegiance.</p>

        <p>The barras bravas here are legendary. Los del Sur, Nacional's organized fan group, is one of the largest and most spectacular in the Americas. Their choreographed displays — massive flags, coordinated jumping, avalanchas (human waves that cascade down the steep terraces), and non-stop singing from first whistle to last — are a spectacle that transcends football. On the other end, Rexixtenxia Norte, DIM's barra, matches them in volume, creativity, and sheer defiance. When these two groups face each other on Clasico Paisa night, the Atanasio Girardot becomes one of the loudest stadiums on the continent.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Medellin, you do not choose your football club — your football club chooses you. It is in your blood before you can walk. Green or red. Nacional or Medellin. And once it is decided, there is no going back. Not ever."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Beyond football, Medellin is a city that has reinvented itself in extraordinary ways. The Metro de Medellin and its MetroCable gondola system connect the valley floor to the hillside comunas, transforming neighborhoods that were once cut off from the rest of the city. The nightlife in El Poblado and Laureles is vibrant and welcoming. The food culture — anchored by the legendary bandeja paisa — is hearty, generous, and designed for people who work hard and play harder. For the traveling football fan, Medellin offers an experience that combines world-class passion with genuine warmth, affordability, and one of the most pleasant climates you will ever encounter on a football trip.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="must-visit-stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Medellin's football life revolves around a single stadium complex that is the shared home of both major clubs. The Atanasio Girardot is not just a stadium — it is the epicenter of Paisa football culture and one of the most atmospheric grounds in South America.</p>

        <!-- Atanasio Girardot -->
        <h3 id="atanasio-girardot">Estadio Atanasio Girardot — Atletico Nacional &amp; DIM</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~40,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Unidad Deportiva Atanasio Girardot, Laureles-Estadio, Comuna 11<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1953 (major renovations in 2011)</p>

        <p>The Estadio Atanasio Girardot is Medellin's football cathedral. Named after an independence-era military leader, the stadium sits within a larger sports complex in the Laureles-Estadio neighborhood that includes an athletics track, swimming pools, basketball courts, and coliseums. But on matchday, everything else fades. The Atanasio — as locals call it — belongs entirely to football.</p>

        <p>The stadium has four distinct stands. The Sur (South) stand is the domain of Los del Sur, Nacional's massive barra brava, and it is one of the most visually spectacular terrace sections in the Americas. On big nights — Libertadores matches, Clasico Paisa fixtures, title deciders — Los del Sur produce choreographed displays that are planned weeks in advance: gigantic flags that cover entire sections, thousands of streamers launched simultaneously, and coordinated jumping that makes the concrete literally vibrate. The Norte (North) stand belongs to Rexixtenxia Norte, DIM's organized supporters, who bring their own brand of noise and spectacle. The Occidental (West) and Oriental (East) stands are the more family-friendly, general admission sections where the view is excellent and the atmosphere, while still intense, is more accessible for visiting fans.</p>

        <p>The acoustic design of the Atanasio amplifies the crowd noise in a way that few South American stadiums can match. The steep, enclosed bowl traps sound and recycles it back onto the pitch. When 40,000 people are singing in unison, the effect is physical — you feel the bass frequencies of the drums and the chanting in your ribcage. The Medellin climate adds to the experience: warm evening air, open sky, the mountains visible beyond the floodlights, and a sunset that paints the valley in orange and gold as the teams walk onto the pitch for a night match.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> The stadium is superbly connected. The Metro station "Estadio" on Line A drops you within a five-minute walk of the gates. From El Poblado, it is a 15-minute Metro ride northbound. From Laureles, you can walk in 10-15 minutes along the Carrera 70 corridor. Taxis and ride-hailing apps from anywhere in the city cost 3-8 USD. On matchday, the streets around the sports complex fill with fans, vendors, and drums starting two to three hours before kickoff.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Arrive at least two hours before kickoff for a Nacional match. The pre-match experience around the Atanasio Girardot is not to be missed — the entire Unidad Deportiva transforms into a giant open-air gathering with street food vendors, beer stalls, face painters, jersey sellers, and groups of fans rehearsing chants with drums and trumpets. Walk the full perimeter of the sports complex to take it all in before entering through the gates.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Training Complex -->
        <h3 id="training-grounds">Sede Deportiva de Atletico Nacional — Guarne</h3>

        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Guarne, eastern Antioquia (approximately 30 km from Medellin center)<br>
        <strong>Access:</strong> Not generally open to the public, but worth knowing about</p>

        <p>Nacional's modern training complex is located outside the city in the municipality of Guarne. While it is not open to casual visitors, the club occasionally hosts open training sessions and community events. If you are a dedicated fan interested in seeing where the squad prepares, check Nacional's official social media channels for any open-door events during your visit. The drive from Medellin through the eastern hills is scenic and takes about 45 minutes.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: DERBIES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Medellin's football identity is defined by one rivalry above all others, plus a handful of high-profile fixtures that bring visiting barras into the Aburra Valley and raise the temperature inside the Atanasio.</p>

        <!-- Clasico Paisa -->
        <h3 id="clasico-paisa">Atletico Nacional vs DIM — El Clasico Paisa</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 85/100</strong></p>

        <p>El Clasico Paisa is the defining football event in Medellin and arguably the most intense derby in Colombian football. Atletico Nacional, founded in 1947, and Deportivo Independiente Medellin, founded in 1913 as the oldest club in the city, have been rivals for the better part of a century. But the dynamic is not one of equals. Nacional is the dominant force — the most titled club in Colombia, winner of two Copa Libertadores trophies (1989 and 2016), and the club with the largest fanbase in the country. DIM, by contrast, has fewer trophies but an identity forged in resistance: the underdog, the people's team, the red heart of the working-class barrios.</p>

        <p>This imbalance is precisely what makes the Clasico Paisa so explosive. Nacional fans expect to win and see anything less as a catastrophe. DIM fans live for the upset, for the night when the red half of the city can celebrate while the green half suffers. When DIM beats Nacional, the red neighborhoods erupt. When Nacional wins, it is confirmation of the natural order. Either way, the atmosphere inside the Atanasio Girardot on derby night is unforgettable.</p>

        <p>The visual spectacle is extraordinary. Los del Sur, occupying the entire south end, produce flags, banners, and tifo displays that rival anything in Argentina or Brazil. The avalancha — a controlled human wave where thousands of fans surge forward and downward on the steep terracing — is one of the most thrilling sights in world football. At the north end, Rexixtenxia Norte answers with their own displays, their own drums, their own defiant chanting that refuses to be drowned out. The neutral stands on the sides are caught in the crossfire of sound, and the effect is overwhelming.</p>

        <p>The match itself is always combative. Hard tackles, theatrical confrontations, red cards, and moments of individual brilliance are the standard ingredients. Referees are under immense pressure, and every decision is met with a wall of noise from one end or the other. The Clasico Paisa is not a match for the faint-hearted — it is raw, visceral, and completely addictive.</p>

            Important note about the Clasico Paisa
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Clasico Paisa is a high-tension event. Do not wear green in the DIM sections or red in the Nacional sections. The stands are strictly divided and mistakes are not taken lightly. If you are a neutral, pick one side and commit — buy your ticket in that team's section, wear their colors or neutral clothing, and behave as their fan for the night. After the match, leave immediately via the main exits and take a taxi or ride-hailing app. Do not linger around the stadium perimeter, especially near the exits of the opposing barra. Police presence is heavy but the streets can be chaotic when 40,000 fans pour out simultaneously.</p>

        <h3 id="other-matchups">Other Notable Matchups in Medellin</h3>

        <p>While the Clasico Paisa is the marquee event, Medellin hosts other compelling fixtures throughout the Liga BetPlay season and in continental competition:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nacional vs Millonarios:</strong> When Millonarios (from Bogota) visits the Atanasio, it is a clash of the two biggest clubs in Colombia. Nacional's home advantage in the valley, combined with the intensity of Los del Sur, makes this one of the toughest away trips in Colombian football. The blue Millonarios traveling contingent adds a genuine antagonism to the atmosphere.</li>
          <li><strong>Nacional vs America de Cali:</strong> Another massive fixture. America, from Cali, is one of Nacional's historical rivals at the national level. The green-versus-red color clash and the mutual history of title races create a charged atmosphere whenever America visits. The visiting barra — Baron Rojo Sur — is one of the most committed traveling fanbases in the country.</li>
          <li><strong>DIM vs Junior de Barranquilla:</strong> A growing rivalry fueled by recent encounters in semifinals and finals. When Junior visits from the Caribbean coast, they bring heat, drums, and a fanbase that is loud and proud. The cultural contrast — Caribbean against Paisa — adds an extra layer.</li>
          <li><strong>Copa Libertadores nights:</strong> Nacional in the Libertadores is a special experience. The club has deep continental pedigree — two Libertadores titles and multiple campaigns — and the Atanasio Girardot on a Libertadores night, with the full weight of Los del Sur behind the team, is one of the most daunting venues in South American football. Visiting Brazilian, Argentine, and Paraguayan clubs arrive knowing they are walking into a cauldron. These are bucket-list nights.</li>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: THE BARRAS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="barras-bravas">The Barras Bravas</h2>

        <p>Medellin's barras bravas are among the most organized, creative, and passionate in South America. Understanding who they are and how they operate is essential for any visiting football fan.</p>

        <h3>Los del Sur — Atletico Nacional</h3>
        <p>Los del Sur is Nacional's principal barra brava, occupying the entire south stand (Sur) of the Atanasio Girardot. Founded in 1997, they have grown into one of the largest organized fan groups in the Americas, with sub-groups (known as "combos") spread across every neighborhood of Medellin and satellite chapters in cities across Colombia and internationally. On matchday, Los del Sur arrive hours before kickoff, unfurling massive flags, setting up drums and instruments, and coordinating the choreography that will accompany the team from the tunnel to the final whistle.</p>

        <p>Their signature move is the avalancha — a controlled, wave-like surge of bodies down the steep terracing that happens after every Nacional goal. It looks dangerous from the outside, and it is not without risk, but for the participants it is a ritualized expression of joy that is deeply ingrained in the culture. The singing is non-stop, led by a capo (song leader) positioned on a platform facing the crowd, who uses a megaphone and hand signals to direct the chants. The repertoire is vast — dozens of songs adapted from cumbia, salsa, and rock melodies, each with lyrics that celebrate Nacional, mock DIM, and tell the story of what it means to be green.</p>

        <h3>Rexixtenxia Norte — DIM</h3>
        <p>Rexixtenxia Norte is DIM's principal barra brava, based in the north stand (Norte). The deliberate misspelling of "Resistencia" with X's is a stylistic choice rooted in the barra's identity — a visual marker of defiance and uniqueness. Founded in 2000, Rexixtenxia Norte positions itself as the voice of the underdog, the red resistance against Nacional's dominance. Their identity is built on loyalty through adversity: supporting DIM through relegation battles, poor seasons, and financial crises, and celebrating every victory as if it were a title.</p>

        <p>Rexixtenxia Norte is smaller than Los del Sur in raw numbers, but what they lack in size they compensate for in intensity. Their chanting is relentless, their flag displays are creative, and their commitment to the cause is total. On Clasico Paisa nights, the north end of the Atanasio vibrates with a particular kind of energy — the energy of a fanbase that knows it is outnumbered but refuses to be silenced. For the neutral visitor, watching Rexixtenxia Norte in full voice is one of the most authentic fan experiences in Colombian football.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">As a foreign visitor, do not enter the barra sections (Sur for Nacional, Norte for DIM) unless you are invited by someone within the group. These are tightly organized spaces with their own rules and hierarchies. The Occidental and Oriental stands offer excellent views of the barras in action without the physical intensity of being inside the avalancha. From the side stands, you can see the full choreography of both ends and appreciate the spectacle in its entirety.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Medellin is a city organized by comunas (districts) within the Aburra Valley. The valley runs roughly north to south, with the city center in the middle and residential neighborhoods spreading up the hillsides. For football fans, the choice of neighborhood matters — proximity to the stadium, access to the Metro, nightlife, and safety all factor in.</p>

        <h3>Laureles</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The ideal base for football fans, without question. Laureles sits directly adjacent to the Estadio Atanasio Girardot — you can walk from most hostels and hotels in Laureles to the stadium in 10-15 minutes. The neighborhood has a strong local Paisa character that feels authentic and lived-in, unlike the more tourist-oriented El Poblado. The Carrera 70 corridor — known as "La 70" — is the social spine of Laureles: a tree-lined avenue packed with restaurants, bars, cafes, and bakeries where you can spend an entire day. On matchday, La 70 fills with fans in jerseys heading toward the stadium, and the pre-match energy is palpable. Accommodation is cheaper than El Poblado, and the quality is excellent. Safety is generally good, though standard precautions apply at night on quieter streets.</p>

        <h3>El Poblado</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Nightlife, international travelers, and the highest concentration of hostels and hotels. El Poblado is Medellin's most upscale and tourist-friendly neighborhood, centered around the Parque Lleras area where bars, restaurants, and clubs create a lively scene every night of the week. It is the safest neighborhood for tourists, well-policed, and well-lit. The downside for football fans is distance: El Poblado is south of the city center, and the stadium is in the west. The Metro ride from Poblado station to Estadio station takes about 15 minutes, or a taxi costs 5-10 USD. After a night match, getting back to El Poblado is easy by ride-hailing app, but budget 20-30 minutes.</p>

        <h3>La Candelaria (Downtown)</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget travelers and those who want to see the gritty, real Medellin. La Candelaria is the historic downtown core — the Parque Berrio, the Museo de Antioquia, the Botero Plaza with its famous sculptures, and the busy commercial streets that pulse with the energy of a working Latin American city center. Accommodation here is the cheapest in the city. The stadium is reachable by Metro in minutes (Parque Berrio station to Estadio station). However, safety is a more serious concern than in Laureles or El Poblado, especially at night. Stick to main streets, avoid displaying valuables, and take taxis after dark rather than walking.</p>

        <h3>Envigado</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> A quieter alternative with its own football identity. Envigado is a municipality immediately south of Medellin proper (though it feels seamlessly connected) that is home to Envigado FC, a smaller Liga BetPlay club known for its excellent youth academy. The neighborhood is calmer and more residential than El Poblado or Laureles, with good restaurants and a pleasant town-center vibe. The Metro Envigado station connects you to the rest of the city. It is farther from the Atanasio (25-30 minutes by Metro), but if you prefer a slower pace outside of matchday, Envigado is a solid choice.</p>

            Areas to avoid
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Exercise caution in certain hillside comunas and peripheral areas.</strong> While Medellin has transformed dramatically, some comunas on the upper slopes — particularly in the northeast and northwest — still have security issues and are not recommended for tourists without a local guide. The area around the Estadio on matchday is safe due to heavy police presence, but after the match, head directly to the Metro or take a taxi rather than wandering into unfamiliar streets. In La Candelaria, avoid the area north of the river (Rio Medellin) at night, and do not venture into the streets east of Carrera 46 after dark without local guidance.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Medellin has the best public transport system in Colombia, and arguably one of the best in South America. The Metro de Medellin — the only metro system in the country — is the backbone of the city's transport network, complemented by the innovative MetroCable gondola lines that climb the steep hillsides. For football fans, this means getting to and from the stadium is remarkably easy and cheap.</p>

        <h3>Metro de Medellin</h3>
        <p>The Metro is the fastest, safest, and most reliable way to get around Medellin. Line A runs north-south through the valley (Niquía to La Estrella), and Line B branches west from San Antonio station toward San Javier. The station you need for the Atanasio Girardot is simply called "Estadio" — it is on Line A, between Suramericana and Caribe stations. From El Poblado, the journey takes about 15 minutes. From downtown (Parque Berrio), it is about 5 minutes. A single ride costs under 1 USD using a rechargeable Civica card, which you can buy and top up at any station.</p>

        <p>The Metro de Medellin is a source of immense civic pride. Paisas (the people of the Antioquia region) treat the system with notable respect — it is remarkably clean, graffiti-free, and orderly compared to transport systems in other Latin American cities. On matchday, the Metro handles the surge of fans with impressive efficiency. Trains run frequently, and the Estadio station has direct access points that funnel fans toward the sports complex. After the match, expect crowds on the platform — give yourself 15-20 minutes of waiting time for a train.</p>

        <h3>MetroCable</h3>
        <p>The MetroCable is Medellin's gondola system, originally designed as a social infrastructure project to connect the hillside comunas to the Metro network. Lines K, J, H, and M climb steeply from valley-floor Metro stations up into the mountains, offering spectacular views of the city below. While you will not use the MetroCable to get to the stadium, riding it is an essential Medellin experience on a non-matchday. Line K from Acevedo station to Santo Domingo Savio, followed by a walk to Parque Arvi, is one of the best urban rides in South America. Line J from San Javier provides access to Comuna 13 and its famous graffiti-covered escalators.</p>

        <h3>Taxis</h3>
        <p>Taxis in Medellin are yellow, metered, and cheap. A ride across the city typically costs 3-8 USD. Medellin taxis are generally considered safer and more honest than those in Bogota, but it is still advisable to use official taxi apps (Tappsi) or ride-hailing apps for added security. On matchday, taxis are a good option if you are not near a Metro station, but traffic around the stadium area gets congested in the final hour before kickoff. If you take a taxi, ask to be dropped at a point a few blocks from the stadium and walk the rest.</p>

        <h3>Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
        <p>Uber, DiDi, and InDrive all operate in Medellin. Uber functions in the same legal gray zone as in Bogota, but it works seamlessly and is widely used. InDrive lets you negotiate fares, which can save money on longer rides. After the match, these apps are your best option for getting home quickly — request your ride as the final minutes approach, and set a pickup point two to three blocks away from the stadium to avoid the worst of the post-match traffic.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport (Jose Maria Cordova — MDE)</h3>
        <p>Medellin's international airport, Jose Maria Cordova (MDE), is not in Medellin at all — it is located in the municipality of Rionegro, about 35 kilometers east of the city in the highlands above the Aburra Valley. The drive from the airport to the city takes 45-75 minutes depending on traffic, descending through a winding mountain highway with dramatic views of the valley. Options: official airport taxis (fixed fare, approximately 25-35 USD to El Poblado), shared shuttle vans (10-15 USD per person, available outside the terminal), or ride-hailing apps (15-25 USD). There is also a smaller domestic airport, Olaya Herrera (EOH), located right in the city center near the river — if you are flying from Bogota, check if your airline offers flights to EOH, as it saves you the long drive from Rionegro.</p>

            Matchday Metro tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">On matchday, the Metro de Medellin operates extended hours and increases train frequency, but the Estadio station gets extremely crowded in the 30 minutes after the final whistle. If you want to avoid the crush, either leave the stadium 5 minutes before the end or wait 20-30 minutes after the match inside the ground for the initial wave to clear. Alternatively, walk one station in either direction (to Suramericana or Caribe) and board from there — the platforms will be much less crowded.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: FOOD & PREVIA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="food-and-previa">Food &amp; The Pre-Match Scene</h2>

        <p>Paisa food culture is legendary in Colombia — hearty, generous, unapologetically heavy, and designed for people who believe that a proper meal should leave you unable to move for at least 30 minutes. The pre-match scene around the Atanasio Girardot taps directly into this culture, and eating your way through a Medellin matchday is an experience in itself.</p>

        <h3>The Pre-Match at the Atanasio</h3>
        <p>On matchday, the Unidad Deportiva Atanasio Girardot and the surrounding streets transform into an open-air festival. Starting roughly three hours before kickoff, the area fills with makeshift food stalls, beer vendors, jersey sellers, face painters, and groups of fans gathering around car speakers blasting reggaeton and salsa. The smell of grilled chorizo, fried empanadas, and roasting corn fills the warm evening air. Aguardiente bottles circulate in circles of friends. Drums start up, and impromptu chanting breaks out as fans from both clubs — though on different sides of the complex — prepare for the match.</p>

        <p>The Carrera 70 corridor in Laureles is the best pre-match staging ground. The bars and restaurants along La 70 fill with fans in green (Nacional) or red (DIM) jerseys, and the atmosphere builds steadily as kickoff approaches. Many fans eat dinner at La 70 restaurants before walking to the stadium. It is the closest thing Medellin has to a European-style matchday pub crawl, adapted for the tropics.</p>

        <h3>What to Eat</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bandeja Paisa:</strong> The signature dish of the Antioquia region and a strong candidate for the most calorically dense meal in South America. A single bandeja paisa contains red beans, white rice, ground beef, chicharron (fried pork belly), fried egg, sweet plantain, arepa, avocado, and a slice of hogao (tomato and onion sauce). It is served on a massive platter, and finishing it is a point of Paisa pride. A bandeja at a neighborhood restaurant costs 4-8 USD. Do not eat one right before the match — you will fall asleep in your seat.</li>
          <li><strong>Empanadas:</strong> The quintessential Colombian street food and the default pre-match snack. Medellin empanadas are deep-fried corn pockets filled with seasoned potato and ground beef, served with aji (spicy salsa) and a squeeze of lime. Sold everywhere around the stadium for less than 1 USD each. Buy three, eat them standing up, and wash them down with a cold beer.</li>
          <li><strong>Arepa de Chocolo:</strong> A sweet corn arepa stuffed with melted white cheese (quesito). The Paisa version is thicker and sweeter than arepas from other regions. It is a perfect snack — warm, slightly sweet, and deeply satisfying. Street vendors sell them near the stadium and along La 70 for 1-2 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Chorizo Santarrosano:</strong> A thick, smoky pork sausage grilled over charcoal and served on an arepa with lime. Named after the town of Santa Rosa de Osos in northern Antioquia, this is one of the great street meats of Colombia. The grilled chorizo vendors around the Atanasio are some of the best in the city.</li>
          <li><strong>Mondongo:</strong> A traditional Paisa tripe soup, thick and hearty, served with rice and avocado. It is not for everyone — the texture of tripe divides opinion — but if you are adventurous, a bowl of mondongo at a Laureles neighborhood restaurant is a genuine local experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Buñuelos and Pandebono:</strong> Fried cheese balls (buñuelos) and cheese bread rolls (pandebono) are the staple snacks of Paisa culture, available at every bakery and street stall. Cheap, addictive, and perfect with a tinto (Colombian black coffee) before heading to the stadium.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Drink</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aguardiente Antioqueno:</strong> The official drink of the Paisa people and the fuel of every matchday. Aguardiente (literally "burning water") is an anise-flavored sugarcane spirit that is consumed in shots, usually shared from a communal bottle among a group of friends. Aguardiente Antioqueno is the regional brand and a source of fierce local pride — do not confuse it with aguardiente from other departments. It is strong, sweet, and warming. Essential to the pre-match ritual, but pace yourself.</li>
          <li><strong>Pilsen beer:</strong> While Poker dominates in Bogota, Pilsen is the beer of choice in Medellin. A light, easy-drinking lager that is everywhere — street stalls, bars, stadiums. A bottle at a pre-match vendor costs about 1-2 USD.</li>
          <li><strong>Club Colombia:</strong> A slightly more premium Colombian beer, available in golden, red, and black (stout) varieties. The golden version is an excellent match companion. Available at restaurants and some stadium vendors.</li>
          <li><strong>Jugo de Lulo:</strong> Fresh lulo (naranjilla) juice, a distinctly Colombian fruit with a tart, citrusy flavor. Sold at juice stalls and street vendors throughout the city. Non-alcoholic, refreshing, and a perfect antidote to the warm Medellin evening.</li>
          <li><strong>Tinto:</strong> Colombian black coffee, served sweet and small. Medellin is in the heart of Colombia's coffee region, and the tinto culture here is deeply embedded in daily life. A cup from a street vendor costs a few cents and is the default way to start any day, including matchday.</li>
        </ul>

            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Unlike Bogota, altitude is not a major concern in Medellin — at 1,495m, the air is comfortable and you will not experience soroche. This means you can drink more freely and eat heavier than you would at 2,640m. But pace the aguardiente — it creeps up on you, especially in the warm evening air, and you want to remember the match. The best strategy: eat a solid bandeja paisa for lunch, have empanadas and beer before the match, and save the serious aguardiente session for the post-match celebrations at La 70.</p>

        <p>Medellin is one of the most affordable football destinations in South America.

          <p class="info-box__text">The Colombian peso fluctuates significantly, so check the current exchange rate before traveling. ATMs are abundant in El Poblado and Laureles and accept international cards (Visa, Mastercard). Withdraw cash before heading to the stadium — ATMs around the Atanasio are scarce and queues grow long on matchday. Most restaurants and shops in tourist areas accept credit cards, but street vendors, empanada stalls, Metro cards, and pre-match beer vendors are strictly cash-only. Carry small bills — vendors often cannot change large denominations like 50,000 or 100,000 peso notes.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Medellin has undergone one of the most remarkable urban transformations in modern history. The city that was once synonymous with violence has become a globally recognized model of urban innovation and resilience. For tourists, it is significantly safer than its reputation suggests, and most visitors have entirely positive experiences. However, it is still a large Latin American city, and the football context adds specific considerations.</p>

        <h3>General Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear team colors outside the stadium area.</strong> Keep your jersey in your bag during the day and put it on only when you are approaching the Atanasio or are in the company of other fans heading to the match. Wearing a Nacional or DIM jersey in the wrong neighborhood can attract unwanted attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Phone theft is the most common crime affecting tourists.</strong> Do not walk around with your phone in your hand, especially in crowded areas, near Metro stations, or on commercial streets. Keep it in your front pocket or a zippered bag. On matchday, the area around the stadium is particularly crowded, making it easier for pickpockets.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps after dark.</strong> Medellin is generally safe to walk around in El Poblado and Laureles during the evening, but after the match, take an Uber, DiDi, or taxi directly to your accommodation rather than wandering unfamiliar streets.</li>
          <li><strong>"No dar papaya."</strong> The Colombian golden rule: do not make yourself an easy target. Keep valuables out of sight, do not flash expensive watches or cameras, avoid counting cash in public, and be aware of your surroundings. This is basic common sense, but it bears repeating.</li>
          <li><strong>La Candelaria (downtown) requires extra caution at night.</strong> During the day, the downtown area is bustling and generally safe for tourists. After dark, the commercial streets empty and security risks increase. Take taxis after sunset in this area.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid the hillside comunas without a local guide.</strong> While some comunas like Comuna 13 have become popular tourist attractions (and are safe with a guided tour during the day), venturing into hillside neighborhoods independently, especially at night, is not advisable.</li>
          <li><strong>Drink spiking awareness.</strong> In the nightlife areas of El Poblado (Parque Lleras in particular), there have been reported cases of drink spiking with scopolamine. Never accept drinks from strangers, watch your glass, and stick with friends. This is not specific to football, but it is worth mentioning for anyone combining their football trip with Medellin nightlife.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Matchday-Specific Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Arrive early, leave promptly.</strong> Get to the stadium at least 90 minutes before kickoff. After the match, exit through the main designated routes and head straight for the Metro or your pre-booked taxi. The most chaotic period is the first 20 minutes after the final whistle.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid the barra sections unless invited.</strong> The Sur (Los del Sur, Nacional) and Norte (Rexixtenxia Norte, DIM) stands are the territory of organized fan groups. They are safe for their members but not ideal for uninitiated visitors. The Occidental and Oriental stands are where you want to be.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not photograph the barras without permission.</strong> Members of barras bravas can be sensitive about being photographed, especially close-up. From the side stands, photographing the general atmosphere is fine. Getting a camera in the face of a barra member is not.</li>
          <li><strong>Clasico Paisa nights require heightened awareness.</strong> Tension between Nacional and DIM fans is real and historically has led to isolated incidents around the stadium. Stay within the flow of fans heading to the Metro or taxi areas, do not engage in provocative behavior, and be neutral in your demeanor if you are not affiliated with either side.</li>
        </ul>

            About the barras bravas
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Medellin's barras bravas — Los del Sur and Rexixtenxia Norte — are deeply embedded in the city's social fabric. They are not just football fan groups; they are neighborhood organizations with complex internal structures. As a foreign visitor, you are generally not a target, and many barra members are welcoming to respectful outsiders who show genuine interest. But respect the boundaries: do not enter their sections uninvited, do not provoke, do not wear rival colors in their territory, and treat the experience with the seriousness it deserves. If you follow these basic rules, your matchday experience will be extraordinary.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: BEYOND FOOTBALL ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="beyond-football">Beyond Football</h2>

        <p>Medellin offers far more than football, and a well-rounded trip should include some of the city's remarkable non-football attractions. Here are the highlights for the visiting fan with a day or two between matches.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Comuna 13 and the Graffitour:</strong> Once one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city, Comuna 13 has been transformed through art, infrastructure, and community resilience. The outdoor escalators (the first of their kind built in a hillside neighborhood) and the vibrant graffiti covering every surface tell the story of a community that refused to be defined by its past. Guided tours run daily and are highly recommended.</li>
          <li><strong>MetroCable to Parque Arvi:</strong> Take Metro Line A to Acevedo station, then transfer to MetroCable Line K to Santo Domingo Savio, and continue on the cable car to Parque Arvi — a cloud forest nature reserve above the city. The ride offers breathtaking views of the valley, and the park has hiking trails, fresh air, and a complete escape from the urban energy below.</li>
          <li><strong>Botero Plaza and Museo de Antioquia:</strong> In the downtown core, the plaza displays 23 massive bronze sculptures by Fernando Botero, Medellin's most famous artist. The adjacent Museo de Antioquia houses more of his work alongside other Colombian and Latin American art. Free to visit the plaza; the museum has a small entry fee.</li>
          <li><strong>Guatape and El Penol:</strong> A day trip to the town of Guatape (about 2 hours east of Medellin) is one of the best excursions in Colombia. The massive rock of El Penol — 740 steps to the top — offers a panoramic view of a reservoir dotted with islands. The town itself is colorful, quiet, and charming. Shared transport from Medellin's Terminal del Norte costs about 3-5 USD each way.</li>
          <li><strong>Coffee farm tours:</strong> Medellin is on the edge of Colombia's Eje Cafetero (Coffee Axis), and day trips to working coffee fincas (farms) in the nearby hills of Antioquia are easy to arrange. Learn how Colombian coffee goes from cherry to cup, sample freshly roasted beans, and see the landscapes that fuel the country's most famous export.</li>
        </ul>

                Both clubs sell tickets through their official websites and through the TuBoleta platform. Nacional tickets can also be purchased at authorized points of sale throughout Medellin and at the Atanasio Girardot box office on matchday. DIM uses a similar system. For regular Liga BetPlay matches, tickets are usually available on the day of the match, but for the Clasico Paisa and Copa Libertadores fixtures, buying in advance is essential as they sell out fast. Prices range from 8 to 25 USD depending on the section. Bring your passport or a valid ID — it is required for entry. Avoid purchasing from resellers outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets are a known problem.

                Yes, with standard precautions. The Clasico Paisa between Atletico Nacional and DIM is the most intense football experience in Medellin, but it is generally safe for foreign visitors who follow basic rules. Do not wear the colors of one team in the other team's section. Pick a side, buy a ticket in their section, and commit. Arrive early and leave promptly after the final whistle. Use ride-hailing apps or taxis after the match rather than walking through crowded streets. The police presence around the Atanasio Girardot is heavy on derby day. If you are a neutral, the Occidental stand offers a good view and a slightly less intense atmosphere compared to the barras behind the goals.

                Laureles is the best base for football fans. It is the neighborhood closest to the Estadio Atanasio Girardot — you can walk to the stadium in 10-15 minutes. Laureles has a strong local character with excellent restaurants, bars, and cafes along the Carrera 70 corridor. El Poblado is the most popular tourist neighborhood with the best nightlife and the highest concentration of hostels and hotels, but it is farther from the stadium (20-30 minutes by Metro or taxi). La Candelaria (downtown) is close to the stadium and has budget accommodation, but safety requires more caution, especially at night.

                The Liga BetPlay season runs in two halves: Apertura (January to June) and Finalizacion (July to December), so football is played year-round. The best months are February through May and August through November, when the league is in full swing and Copa Libertadores matches may also be scheduled. Medellin is known as the city of eternal spring — temperatures hover between 22 and 28 degrees Celsius year-round at 1,495 meters altitude. There are wetter periods in April-May and September-November, but rain usually comes in short afternoon bursts and rarely disrupts evening matches. December and January see some breaks in the football calendar.

                Medellin is extremely affordable for visitors carrying dollars or euros. A backpacker budget of 30 to 50 USD per day covers a hostel bed (8-18 USD), match tickets (8-25 USD), street food and local restaurants (3-8 USD per meal), and Metro transport (under 1 USD per ride). A comfortable mid-range budget of 60 to 110 USD per day gets you a decent hotel, sit-down restaurants, taxis, and better stadium seats. A bandeja paisa at a neighborhood restaurant costs 4-8 USD, empanadas are under 1 USD each, and a bottle of aguardiente from a liquor store runs 5-10 USD. The Colombian peso offers outstanding value.
