Universitario, Alianza Lima, and Sporting Cristal all sell tickets online for Liga 1 matches, and availability is generally good for regular-season games. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico (Universitario vs Alianza Lima), tickets sell out fast and you may need to buy through the club's membership system or authorized resellers. Prices are very affordable compared to European or Argentine football — expect to pay between 10 and 30 USD for most matches. Avoid buying from street vendors outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets do circulate. Teleticket and Joinnus are the main official ticketing platforms used by Peruvian clubs."

          "text": "Yes, attending a match in Lima is generally safe if you follow basic precautions. Stick to the main areas around the stadium, arrive early, and leave promptly after the final whistle. Avoid wearing rival team colors in neighborhoods strongly associated with one club — for example, do not wear an Alianza Lima jersey near the Monumental on matchday, and vice versa. The police presence around stadiums on matchday is significant. Take a taxi or ride-hailing app (Uber, InDrive, DiDi) to and from the stadium rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. Keep valuables hidden and be aware of your surroundings, as you would in any large Latin American city."

The best months for football tourism are March through May and August through November, when the league is in full swing and the weather is more pleasant (Lima's winter from June to August is grey and cool but rarely rains). The Clasico (Universitario vs Alianza Lima) happens at least twice per season, and Copa Libertadores group-stage matches usually take place between April and June. December and January are the off-season, so avoid those months if football is your primary reason for visiting."

Check the club's official website or social media for the current tour schedule and booking. Alianza Lima's Estadio Alejandro Villanueva (Matute) also occasionally opens for tours, though the schedule is less regular. For both stadiums, it is worth contacting the club directly or checking their social media pages before your visit to confirm availability. Even without an official tour, the exterior of the Monumental and the surrounding Ate district are worth visiting for the murals and fan graffiti."

A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 70 to 120 USD per day. The Peruvian sol offers excellent value for visitors carrying dollars or euros. Ceviche at a market stall costs around 3-5 USD, and a full menu del dia (set lunch) at a local restaurant is typically 2-4 USD."

      <!-- ===== SECTION: WHY LIMA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-lima">Why Lima?</h2>

        <p>Lima is the heartbeat of Peruvian football. It is not just a city where football is played — it is the city where Peruvian football was born, where it grew, where it fights, and where it dreams. Three of the biggest clubs on the continent call Lima home, and between them they carry more than three centuries of combined history. The rivalry between Universitario de Deportes and Alianza Lima — the Clasico of Peruvian football — is one of the oldest and most intense in all of South America, a confrontation that divides families, friendships, and entire neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>For the traveling football fan, Lima offers something increasingly rare in South American football: accessibility. Tickets are affordable, stadiums are reachable by public transport, and the city has a tourist infrastructure that makes the logistics of an away-day far less complicated than in many other capitals. You can fly in, settle into a hostel in Miraflores, take the Metropolitano bus to a match at the Monumental, eat world-class ceviche on the way back, and spend less in a full day than you would on a single ticket in Europe.</p>

        <p>But what truly sets Lima apart is the intersection of football and food culture. Lima is the gastronomic capital of South America — a fact recognized by every major culinary ranking in the world. The pre-match ritual here is not just about beer and snacks. It is about anticuchos grilled over charcoal outside the stadium, ceviche served fresh at a market stall hours before kickoff, chicha morada poured from a jug at a street cart. Football in Lima is a sensory experience that goes far beyond the ninety minutes.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"In Lima, the pre-match starts at the table. You do not go to the stadium on an empty stomach. You eat well, you argue about formations over a plate of lomo saltado, and then you walk to the ground with your belly full and your heart racing."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Lima is also the gateway to the broader Peruvian football experience. From here, you can connect to Cusco, Arequipa, and Trujillo — cities with passionate local clubs and football cultures that feel completely different from the capital. But Lima itself has more than enough to fill an entire football trip: three stadiums, multiple derbies, a Liga 1 calendar that runs most of the year, and a city that wraps its football in the best food on the continent.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: THE CLUBS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="the-clubs">The Big Three</h2>

        <p>Lima's football identity revolves around three clubs that dominate the Peruvian game. Understanding who they are and what they represent is essential before setting foot in any stadium.</p>

        <h3 id="universitario">Universitario de Deportes — La "U"</h3>

        <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1924<br>
        <strong>Nickname:</strong> La "U", Los Cremas<br>
        <strong>Colors:</strong> Cream and red<br>
        <strong>Stadium:</strong> Estadio Monumental</p>

        <p>Universitario de Deportes is the most decorated club in Peruvian football history, holding the record for Liga 1 titles. Born from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos — the oldest university in the Americas — the club carries an identity rooted in academic tradition, though its fanbase today spans every social class across the country. La "U" supporters are known for their massive turnout and their ability to fill the Monumental even for midweek fixtures. The club has a continent-wide reputation thanks to its Copa Libertadores campaigns, and the cream-and-red jersey is one of the most recognizable in South American football.</p>

        <h3 id="alianza-lima">Alianza Lima</h3>

        <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1901<br>
        <strong>Nickname:</strong> Los Blanquiazules, Los Intimos, Los Grones<br>
        <strong>Colors:</strong> Blue and white (vertical stripes)<br>
        <strong>Stadium:</strong> Estadio Alejandro Villanueva "Matute"</p>

        <p>Alianza Lima is the people's club. Founded in the working-class neighborhood of La Victoria, Alianza carries the identity of Lima's Afro-Peruvian community and the popular classes. Its history is marked by both glory and tragedy — the 1987 Fokker disaster, in which nearly the entire first team perished in a plane crash, remains one of the darkest moments in South American football. That tragedy forged a bond between the club and its supporters that is almost impossible to explain to outsiders. Alianza's fanbase, the "Comando Sur," is one of the most organized and vocal barras in Peru. Matchday at Matute is raw, loud, and unforgettable.</p>

        <h3 id="sporting-cristal">Sporting Cristal</h3>

        <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1956<br>
        <strong>Nickname:</strong> Los Celestes, Los Cerveceros (The Brewers)<br>
        <strong>Colors:</strong> Sky blue<br>
        <strong>Stadium:</strong> Estadio Alberto Gallardo</p>

        <p>The third pillar of Lima football. Sporting Cristal was founded by the Backus brewery — hence the nickname "Los Cerveceros" — and represents a more corporate, modern identity within Peruvian football. Despite being younger than Universitario and Alianza Lima, Cristal has amassed an impressive trophy cabinet and has been a consistent force in Copa Libertadores. Their fanbase, while smaller than the other two, is fiercely loyal. The Estadio Alberto Gallardo, their home ground in the Rimac district, is intimate and creates a compact, intense atmosphere that the bigger stadiums cannot replicate.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: MUST-VISIT STADIUMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="must-visit-stadiums">Must-Visit Stadiums</h2>

        <p>Lima's three major stadiums each offer a completely different matchday experience. From the monumental scale of the "U" fortress in Ate to the intimate intensity of Matute in La Victoria, there is no single template for Lima football.</p>

        <!-- Estadio Monumental -->
        <h3 id="estadio-monumental">Estadio Monumental de la U — Universitario de Deportes</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~80,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Ate Vitarte, east Lima<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 2000</p>

        <p>The largest stadium in Peru and one of the biggest in all of South America. The Estadio Monumental is Universitario's fortress — a massive concrete bowl that can hold 80,000 supporters on its best days. When the "U" plays a Clasico or a Copa Libertadores knockout match, the Monumental fills to capacity and produces an atmosphere that rivals anything on the continent. The scale is genuinely staggering: standing in the upper tiers and looking down at the pitch, you understand why they named it "Monumental."</p>

        <p>The stadium is located in the Ate Vitarte district, east of the city center. It is not in the most picturesque part of Lima, and the surrounding area is mostly residential and commercial without much tourist appeal. But the stadium itself is the destination. On matchday, the roads leading to the Monumental fill with vendors selling anticuchos, picarones, and drinks, creating a pre-match street market atmosphere that builds as you approach.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> The most practical option is to take a taxi or ride-hailing app (Uber, InDrive, DiDi) from Miraflores or central Lima — the trip takes 30-50 minutes depending on traffic. Public transport options include the Metro Line 1 to stations in eastern Lima, then a short taxi ride. On matchday, colectivo buses and combis run shuttles from central points. Traffic around the stadium on matchday is severe, so leave at least 90 minutes before kickoff.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Monumental offers guided stadium tours on non-matchdays that include access to the pitch, the tunnel, the presidential box, and the Universitario museum. The museum is surprisingly well-curated and covers the full history of the club. Book via the club's official website or show up early — tours sometimes fill up on weekends.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Estadio Matute -->
        <h3 id="estadio-matute">Estadio Alejandro Villanueva "Matute" — Alianza Lima</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~35,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> La Victoria, central Lima<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1974</p>

        <p>Matute is the soul of Alianza Lima. Named after Alejandro Villanueva — one of the greatest Peruvian footballers of all time — this stadium in the heart of La Victoria is everything the Monumental is not: compact, loud, claustrophobic, and overwhelmingly intense. The stands are close to the pitch, the concrete shakes when the crowd jumps, and the Comando Sur behind one of the goals produces a wall of noise that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.</p>

        <p>Matute is not a modern stadium. The facilities are basic, the seats are weathered, and the infrastructure shows its age. But that is precisely what gives it its character. This is a stadium where you feel the history in the walls. The neighborhood around it — La Victoria — is working-class and rough around the edges, and that gritty authenticity extends into the stadium experience. A night match at Matute, with the floodlights cutting through the Lima fog and 35,000 aliancistas singing in unison, is one of the most powerful football experiences in Peru.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> Matute is centrally located and relatively easy to reach. From Miraflores, a taxi or ride-hailing app takes 20-30 minutes. The Metropolitano bus system has stops within walking distance (Estacion Mexico is the closest). Buses and combis from various parts of Lima pass through La Victoria. On matchday, the streets around the stadium fill with vendors and fans hours before kickoff.</p>

            Important note about La Victoria
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">La Victoria is not a tourist-friendly neighborhood. While the immediate vicinity of the stadium is heavily policed on matchday, the broader area has safety issues. Take a taxi or ride-hailing app directly to and from the stadium. Do not walk around La Victoria at night, and do not wear Universitario or Sporting Cristal colors anywhere near Matute. Arrive early, enjoy the atmosphere inside the stadium zone, and leave promptly after the final whistle.</p>

        <!-- Estadio Alberto Gallardo -->
        <h3 id="estadio-gallardo">Estadio Alberto Gallardo — Sporting Cristal</h3>

        <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> ~18,000<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Rimac, north-central Lima<br>
        <strong>Opened:</strong> 1961</p>

        <p>The smallest of Lima's three major grounds, but in many ways the most charming. The Alberto Gallardo sits in the Rimac district, across the river from the historic center of Lima. With a capacity of around 18,000, it creates an intimate, pressure-cooker atmosphere that the bigger stadiums cannot match. When Cristal plays a big match here — especially against Universitario or Alianza Lima — the compact stands amplify the noise to remarkable levels.</p>

        <p>The Gallardo is a throwback stadium. There is no pretension, no corporate hospitality suites, no LED screens wrapping around the ground. It is just football, close to the pitch, with fans who know every chant by heart. For the traveling fan who has experienced the mega-stadiums of Buenos Aires or Sao Paulo, the Gallardo offers a refreshing change of pace: neighborhood football at its purest, in a city that is simultaneously a capital.</p>

        <p><strong>How to get there:</strong> From central Lima or Miraflores, a taxi or ride-hailing app takes 15-25 minutes. The Metropolitano has stops on Avenida Tupac Amaru that are within walking distance. Bus routes along Avenida Caqueta also serve the area. The Rimac district has historical charm — the Alameda de los Descalzos and the Cerro San Cristobal viewpoint are nearby — but exercise caution walking in the area after dark.</p>

        <h2 id="derbies">Derbies You Need to Experience</h2>

        <p>Lima's football calendar is punctuated by derbies that stop the city. The rivalry between the big three is the engine that drives Peruvian football, and matchday for any of these fixtures transforms the entire capital.</p>

        <!-- El Clasico -->
        <h3 id="clasico-peruano">Universitario vs Alianza Lima — The Clasico of Peruvian Football</h3>

        <p><strong>Hincha Index: 86/100</strong></p>

        <p>This is it. The defining match of Peruvian football. Universitario de Deportes versus Alianza Lima — "La U" against "Los Intimos" — is a rivalry that stretches back over a century and cuts through the social fabric of the entire country. Historically, the divide has carried class and racial undertones: Universitario, born from the university system, was perceived as the club of the middle and upper classes, while Alianza Lima, founded in the working-class streets of La Victoria with deep roots in Lima's Afro-Peruvian community, represented the people. Those narratives have blurred significantly over the decades — both clubs now draw supporters from every social stratum — but the intensity of the rivalry has only grown.</p>

        <p>The Clasico is not just a Lima affair. It splits the entire nation. In Cusco, in Arequipa, in Trujillo, in Iquitos — wherever two Peruvians sit down to watch football together, the question "U o Alianza?" has the power to start a debate that lasts hours. The matchday atmosphere, whether at the Monumental or Matute, is electric. Drums, banners that cover entire stands, chanting that begins hours before kickoff and does not stop until long after the final whistle. The Clasico is Peru's football identity distilled into ninety minutes.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--danger">
          <div class="info-box__title">

            Getting tickets for the Clasico
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Tickets for the Clasico sell out extremely fast. The home club controls ticket sales, and priority goes to club members (socios). For tourists, the best strategy is to check the club's official ticketing platform (Teleticket or Joinnus) as soon as the match date is confirmed. Some tickets may be available to the general public for less-demanded sections. Alternatively, authorized sports tourism agencies in Lima offer Clasico packages. Never buy from scalpers outside the stadium — counterfeit tickets are common, and the security check at the gates is strict.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Other derbies -->
        <h3 id="other-derbies">Other Lima Derbies</h3>

        <p>The Clasico dominates the headlines, but Lima has other rivalries worth knowing about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Universitario vs Sporting Cristal:</strong> Two of the three biggest clubs in the country. This fixture always draws a massive crowd and produces high-intensity football. The tactical and stylistic contrast — Cristal's historically more technical approach versus the "U" raw power — makes for compelling matches.</li>
          <li><strong>Alianza Lima vs Sporting Cristal:</strong> The other leg of the triangle. Alianza's passionate fanbase against Cristal's organized support creates a charged atmosphere, especially at Matute. This rivalry has produced some of the most dramatic finishes in Liga 1 history.</li>
          <li><strong>Universitario vs Alianza Atletico:</strong> When Alianza Atletico from Sullana visits Lima, it brings a provincial intensity that surprises many. Provincial clubs visiting the capital always carry an underdog energy that makes these fixtures entertaining.</li>
          <li><strong>Any Lima club vs a visiting provincial team in Copa Libertadores:</strong> When international football comes to Lima, the city unites behind whichever local club is representing Peru. A Libertadores night at the Monumental, with 70,000+ fans behind a single cause, is one of the great experiences in South American club football.</li>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: NEIGHBORHOODS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="neighborhoods">Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>Choosing the right neighborhood in Lima is critical for your football trip. The city is enormous and sprawling, and traffic can be brutal. Where you sleep determines how easily you reach the stadiums and how comfortably you experience the city between matches.</p>

        <h3>Miraflores</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> First-time visitors, safety-conscious travelers, and those who want the best tourist infrastructure. Miraflores is Lima's most polished district — clean streets, oceanfront parks, excellent restaurants, and an abundance of hostels, hotels, and Airbnbs at every price point. The Malecon boardwalk along the Pacific cliffs is one of the most beautiful urban walks in South America. From Miraflores, you can reach Matute in 20-30 minutes by taxi, the Monumental in 35-50 minutes, and the Gallardo in 20-30 minutes. The Metropolitano bus runs through Miraflores and connects to central Lima. This is the default recommendation for traveling fans who do not know Lima.</p>

        <h3>Barranco</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> The fan who wants nightlife, culture, and a bohemian atmosphere. Barranco is Lima's artsy, bar-filled neighborhood — the place where musicians, artists, and backpackers converge. It is adjacent to Miraflores and equally safe, but with more character: street art on every corner, live music in small venues, and some of the best bars in Lima. The Puente de los Suspiros is a landmark worth visiting. Transport access is similar to Miraflores. Slightly cheaper accommodation, more personality, and a younger crowd. If you are combining football with nightlife, Barranco is your base.</p>

        <h3>Centro Historico</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget travelers and history enthusiasts. Lima's historical center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with stunning colonial architecture — the Plaza Mayor, the Cathedral, the Convento de San Francisco. Accommodation here is the cheapest in the tourist-friendly zones, with hostels starting at 6-8 USD per night. The Centro is well-connected by public transport and is closer to the Gallardo (Rimac is just across the river) and Matute (La Victoria borders the center). The downside: the Centro can feel sketchy after dark, especially around certain plazas and side streets. Stay alert, avoid walking alone at night, and you will be fine.</p>

        <h3>La Victoria</h3>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Hardcore Alianza Lima fans only. La Victoria is the neighborhood where Alianza Lima was born, where Matute stands, and where the club's identity lives in the streets. It is working-class, intense, and not tourist-friendly. We do not recommend staying in La Victoria unless you know the area well or are traveling with local contacts. Visit on matchday, absorb the atmosphere around the stadium, and return to Miraflores or Barranco to sleep.</p>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">

            HinchaViajero Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are planning to attend matches at multiple stadiums during your stay, Miraflores is the best central base. It offers roughly equal access to all three grounds and has the widest range of food, accommodation, and transport options. Book accommodation along or near Avenida Arequipa or Avenida Larco for the best Metropolitano bus access.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around</h2>

        <p>Lima's transport system is chaotic but functional. Understanding your options is essential — especially on matchday, when traffic around the stadiums reaches apocalyptic levels.</p>

        <h3>Metropolitano Bus</h3>
        <p>Lima's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is the backbone of public transport for tourists. The Metropolitano runs on a dedicated lane along the main north-south axis of the city, connecting Chorrillos in the south to Comas in the north, passing through Barranco, Miraflores, central Lima, and Rimac. It is fast, cheap (around 1.50 PEN per ride, roughly 0.40 USD), and avoids the nightmare of Lima traffic. You need a rechargeable card to board. Key stations for football fans: Estacion Central (near the Centro Historico), Estacion Mexico (closest to Matute), and Estacion Naranjal (northern terminus, useful for Rimac connections). The Metropolitano does not reach the Monumental directly — for that, you need a taxi or a connecting bus from eastern Lima.</p>

        <h3>Metro de Lima (Line 1)</h3>
        <p>Lima's single metro line runs elevated through the southern and eastern parts of the city. It is useful for reaching the eastern districts near the Monumental. The line connects Villa El Salvador in the south to San Juan de Lurigancho in the northeast. The most relevant station for football fans is Estacion La Cultura or Estacion Angamos (connecting points to ride-hailing apps for the last stretch to the Monumental). The metro is clean, fast, and very affordable. A second line is under construction but not yet operational.</p>

        <h3>Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps</h3>
        <p>This is your go-to for matchday transport. Uber, InDrive, DiDi, and Beat all operate in Lima and are reliable, affordable, and safe. A ride from Miraflores to Matute costs roughly 8-15 PEN (2-4 USD). From Miraflores to the Monumental, expect 15-30 PEN (4-8 USD) depending on traffic and surge pricing. Always use the app — do not hail random taxis on the street, as unlicensed taxis are common and safety cannot be guaranteed. On matchday, set your drop-off point a few blocks from the stadium, as traffic makes the last stretch painfully slow.</p>

        <h3>Combis and Micros</h3>
        <p>Lima's informal minibus system is extensive, extremely cheap, and utterly confusing for first-time visitors. Combis (small vans) and micros (larger buses) cover virtually every route in the city, but they have no standardized maps, inconsistent schedules, and require local knowledge to navigate. Unless you speak Spanish and enjoy adventure, stick to the Metropolitano, the Metro, and ride-hailing apps. That said, if a local friend offers to guide you to a match via combi, say yes — it is an experience in itself.</p>

        <h3>From the Airport</h3>
        <p><strong>Jorge Chavez International Airport (LIM)</strong> is located in Callao, about 30-45 minutes from Miraflores depending on traffic. Options: official airport taxis (fixed rate, around 60-80 PEN / 16-22 USD to Miraflores), ride-hailing apps from the designated pick-up zone (40-60 PEN / 11-16 USD), or the Airport Express Lima shuttle bus to Miraflores (15 PEN / 4 USD, runs every 30 minutes). Do not accept offers from touts inside the terminal — always use official services or pre-book your transfer.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: PRE-MATCH ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="pre-match">The Lima Pre-Match Scene — Food & La Previa</h2>

        <p>Lima is the gastronomic capital of South America, and that distinction extends to its football culture. The pre-match ritual here is inseparable from food. While Argentine fans gather around the grill for choripan, Lima fans gather around the anticucho cart, the cevicheria, and the picarones stand. Football and food merge into a single experience that makes a matchday in Lima something truly unique.</p>

        <h3>Anticuchos</h3>
        <p>The king of Lima street food, and the undisputed star of the pre-match scene. Anticuchos are skewers of marinated beef heart, grilled over charcoal and served with boiled potatoes and a fiery aji sauce. They appear on every street corner near every stadium hours before kickoff — the smell of charcoal smoke is your signal that you are approaching the ground. A portion of anticuchos costs 5-10 PEN (1.50-3 USD) and is one of the great culinary experiences in South America. Do not let the "beef heart" description scare you: when properly grilled, anticuchos are tender, smoky, and addictive. Every regular matchday fan has a favorite anticucho vendor near their stadium.</p>

        <h3>Ceviche</h3>
        <p>Peru's national dish and a non-negotiable part of any Lima visit. Fresh raw fish cured in lime juice, mixed with red onion, aji peppers, and cilantro, served with sweet potato and crunchy corn (cancha). Ceviche is traditionally a daytime food — Peruvians eat it for lunch, not dinner — so plan accordingly. Hit a cevicheria in Miraflores or Surquillo market before an afternoon match, and you will arrive at the stadium in a state of culinary bliss. A plate of ceviche at a market stall costs 10-18 PEN (3-5 USD). At a sit-down restaurant, expect 25-50 PEN (7-14 USD).</p>

        <h3>Lomo Saltado</h3>
        <p>Peru's beloved stir-fry: strips of beef sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and aji amarillo, mixed with french fries and served over rice. It is the quintessential fusion of Chinese and Peruvian cooking (a style called "chifa") and one of the most satisfying meals in the country. A hearty plate of lomo saltado at a local restaurant will run you 12-25 PEN (3-7 USD), and it is the perfect fuel for a long evening at the stadium. Many fans eat lomo saltado as their pre-match meal, often at a neighborhood chifa restaurant.</p>

        <h3>Chicha Morada</h3>
        <p>A deep purple drink made from boiled purple corn, cinnamon, cloves, and lime. Non-alcoholic, refreshing, and quintessentially Peruvian. It is sold at street carts, in restaurants, and from vendors outside every stadium. A glass costs 1-3 PEN (0.30-0.80 USD). If you want to go local, order a chicha morada before the match instead of a beer — it marks you as someone who knows what they are doing.</p>

        <h3>Picarones</h3>
        <p>Sweet potato and squash doughnuts, deep-fried and drizzled with a warm fig and anise syrup called miel de chancaca. Picarones vendors set up near stadiums and in public plazas, and on a cool Lima evening, a plate of freshly fried picarones is comfort food at its finest. A serving costs 3-6 PEN (0.80-1.60 USD).</p>

        <h3>Beer</h3>
        <p>Cusquena, Pilsen, and Cristal (no relation to the football club) are the main Peruvian beer brands. A large bottle (630ml) at a bodega or street vendor costs 5-8 PEN (1.40-2.20 USD). Peru also has a growing craft beer scene, particularly in Miraflores and Barranco, though the stadiums themselves are strictly mass-market territory. On matchday, the streets near the stadium are lined with vendors selling cold bottles from coolers — grab one on your walk in.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">For the ultimate pre-match food experience, visit the Mercado de Surquillo before an afternoon match. Located between Miraflores and Surquillo (a short taxi ride from central Miraflores), this market has incredible ceviche stalls, fresh fruit juice stands, and all the Peruvian staples at rock-bottom prices. It is where locals eat — not tourists — and the quality is outstanding. Eat here, then head to the stadium.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety Tips</h2>

        <p>Lima is a safe city for tourists who exercise the same caution they would in any major Latin American capital. In the football context, there are specific rules that will keep you out of trouble.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do not wear rival colors near the stadium.</strong> This is the golden rule everywhere in South American football, and Lima is no exception. Do not wear a Universitario jersey in the vicinity of Matute, and do not wear Alianza Lima colors near the Monumental. If you are a neutral tourist, wear plain clothes — no club colors at all.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps for transport to and from matches.</strong> Uber, InDrive, DiDi, and Beat are all reliable in Lima. Set your pick-up and drop-off points a few blocks from the stadium to avoid the worst of the matchday traffic. Do not hail unmarked taxis on the street, especially at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep valuables hidden.</strong> Phone theft is common in Lima, particularly on public transport and in crowded areas around stadiums. Keep your phone in a front pocket or inside your jacket. Do not flash expensive cameras or jewelry. Carry only the cash you need for the day.</li>
          <li><strong>Stick to safe neighborhoods at night.</strong> Miraflores and Barranco are safe for walking at night. The Centro Historico, La Victoria, Rimac, and Callao are not. After evening matches, take a taxi or ride-hailing app directly back to your accommodation.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrive early, leave promptly.</strong> Get to the stadium at least 60-90 minutes before kickoff. This gives you time to pass through security, find your seat, and soak in the pre-match atmosphere. After the final whistle, leave promptly — do not linger in the streets around the stadium, especially at night.</li>
          <li><strong>Be cautious in La Victoria.</strong> The neighborhood around Matute is intense and not tourist-friendly. The immediate area around the stadium is policed on matchday, but the broader district has safety issues. Take transport directly to and from the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Altitude is not a factor.</strong> Unlike Cusco, La Paz, or Bogota, Lima is at sea level. You will not experience altitude sickness. However, Lima's coastal humidity and the "garua" (fine drizzle/fog) during winter months (June-September) can make evenings cool — bring a light jacket for night matches.</li>
          <li><strong>Documents and ID.</strong> Carry a photocopy of your passport. Some stadiums and police checkpoints near the ground may ask for identification. Leave your original passport locked at your accommodation.</li>

            About visiting fans in Peru
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Peruvian football has a complicated history with visiting fans. Depending on the security situation and the specific fixture, visiting fan sections may be open, restricted, or closed entirely. High-risk matches (the Clasico, Universitario vs Sporting Cristal) are frequently played with restrictions on away supporters. Check the Liga 1 security announcements before traveling to a match as a visiting fan. If you are a neutral tourist, buy tickets in the home section and behave as a neutral — do not celebrate visiting team goals or wear visiting colors.</p>

                The easiest way is through the official websites or box offices of each club. Universitario, Alianza Lima, and Sporting Cristal all sell tickets online for Liga 1 matches, and availability is generally good for regular-season games. For high-demand fixtures like the Clasico (Universitario vs Alianza Lima), tickets sell out fast and you may need to buy through the club's membership system or authorized resellers. Prices are very affordable compared to European or Argentine football — expect to pay between 10 and 30 USD for most matches. Avoid buying from street vendors outside the stadium, as counterfeit tickets do circulate. Teleticket and Joinnus are the main official ticketing platforms used by Peruvian clubs.

              <div class="faq-answer__inner">
                Yes, attending a match in Lima is generally safe if you follow basic precautions. Stick to the main areas around the stadium, arrive early, and leave promptly after the final whistle. Avoid wearing rival team colors in neighborhoods strongly associated with one club — for example, do not wear an Alianza Lima jersey near the Monumental on matchday, and vice versa. The police presence around stadiums on matchday is significant. Take a taxi or ride-hailing app (Uber, InDrive, DiDi) to and from the stadium rather than walking through unfamiliar streets at night. Keep valuables hidden and be aware of your surroundings, as you would in any large Latin American city.

                The Liga 1 season in Peru typically runs from February through November, with a short mid-year break. The best months for football tourism are March through May and August through November, when the league is in full swing and the weather is more pleasant (Lima's winter from June to August is grey and cool but rarely rains). The Clasico (Universitario vs Alianza Lima) happens at least twice per season, and Copa Libertadores group-stage matches usually take place between April and June. December and January are the off-season, so avoid those months if football is your primary reason for visiting.

                Universitario de Deportes offers guided tours of the Estadio Monumental on certain days, which include access to the pitch, the tunnel, the locker rooms, and the club museum. Check the club's official website or social media for the current tour schedule and booking. Alianza Lima's Estadio Alejandro Villanueva (Matute) also occasionally opens for tours, though the schedule is less regular. For both stadiums, it is worth contacting the club directly or checking their social media pages before your visit to confirm availability. Even without an official tour, the exterior of the Monumental and the surrounding Ate district are worth visiting for the murals and fan graffiti.

                Lima is one of the most affordable football destinations in South America. A backpacker can manage on 30 to 50 USD per day, including hostel accommodation (8-15 USD per night), match tickets (10-30 USD), street food and local restaurants (3-8 USD per meal), and public transport (1-3 USD per day). A more comfortable budget with a mid-range hotel, sit-down restaurants, and taxis would be 70 to 120 USD per day. The Peruvian sol offers excellent value for visitors carrying dollars or euros. Ceviche at a market stall costs around 3-5 USD, and a full menu del dia (set lunch) at a local restaurant is typically 2-4 USD.
