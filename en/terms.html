    <article class="guide-body" aria-label="HinchaViajero terms and conditions of use">

      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: Site Usage ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">1. Site Usage</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">HinchaViajero is an informational content platform about travel for football fans in Latin America. Our guides, articles, rankings, and indexes are designed to help you plan your away-days with better information.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Access to the site is free and open to everyone. You don't need to create an account to read our content. By accessing and browsing HinchaViajero, you agree to these terms and conditions of use.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We ask that you use the site responsibly: don't use it for illegal activities, don't attempt to access internal systems, and don't publish or distribute content that could harm the traveling fan community.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: Informational Content ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">2. Informational Content, Not Professional Advice</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">All content on HinchaViajero is <strong>informational and for guidance purposes only</strong>. Our guides do not constitute professional travel advice, legal advice, or binding recommendations of any kind.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Travel conditions change constantly. Bus ticket prices fluctuate, transport schedules change, visa requirements get updated, and safety conditions in cities and stadiums can vary from one week to the next. That's why we always recommend <strong>verifying information directly with official sources</strong> before traveling: transport companies, government websites, embassies, and consulates.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We do our best to keep content up to date, but we cannot guarantee that every piece of data in every guide reflects reality at the exact moment you're reading it. Use our guides as a starting point for your planning, not as the final word.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 3: Intellectual Property ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">3. Intellectual Property</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">All original content on HinchaViajero, including text, guides, the Indice Hincha rating system, rankings, graphic design, and site structure, is the property of HinchaViajero and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll"><strong>What you can do:</strong> share links to our articles on social media, forums, and fan groups. Quote brief excerpts with proper attribution and a link to the original source. Recommend us to other traveling fans.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll"><strong>What you cannot do:</strong> copy entire articles and publish them as your own. Reproduce our guides on other websites without written authorization. Use our content for commercial purposes without permission.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Unsplash images used on the site are licensed separately under the <a href="https://unsplash.com/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash License</a> and are not the property of HinchaViajero. If you need to use those images, check the terms directly on Unsplash.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: Accuracy of Information ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">4. Accuracy of Information</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We take the quality of our information very seriously. Every guide is written or reviewed by traveling fans with real experience on the routes and in the cities we cover. But let's be honest: <strong>we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy at all times</strong>.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">These are things that change frequently and that you should always verify before traveling:</p>

      <ul class="animate-on-scroll">
        <li><strong>Prices:</strong> bus ticket costs, stadium entry fees, accommodation, and food prices vary by season, demand, and inflation.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedules:</strong> transport services change their frequencies, especially during off-season or for special events.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety conditions:</strong> the security situation in neighborhoods, routes, and stadiums can change significantly from one matchday to the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Immigration requirements:</strong> visa policies and entry requirements are updated periodically.</li>
        <li><strong>Sports regulations:</strong> rules about away fans, ticket sales, and stadium access change from tournament to tournament.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">If you find outdated information on our site, please let us know at <a href="mailto:hola@hinchaviajero.com">hola@hinchaviajero.com</a>. The community is built together.</p>
