You need to be a registered member of the visiting club and purchase through their official channels as soon as tickets go on sale, which is usually 2-4 weeks before the match. Tickets sell out within hours for knockout rounds and finals, so set up alerts and be ready to buy the moment sales open."

For a group stage match on a budget, expect to spend between 150 and 400 USD including transport, ticket, accommodation, and food. For knockout rounds and semifinals, budget between 300 and 800 USD as ticket prices increase and demand pushes up flight and hotel costs. A Libertadores final can cost anywhere from 500 to 2,000 USD depending on whether you fly or take a bus, stay in a hostel or hotel, and how early you book. The biggest variable is always the flight or bus ticket, so book early and consider overnight buses to save on both transport and accommodation."

The key is preparation: research the host city, understand which neighborhoods near the stadium are safe, travel in groups, and follow police instructions on matchday. Avoid wearing your team's jersey outside the stadium area in unfamiliar cities, keep valuables at your accommodation, and always have a clear exit plan after the match. CONMEBOL and local police typically provide designated zones and escort routes for visiting fans during knockout rounds. Use ride-hailing apps instead of street taxis, and share your live location with someone you trust throughout the trip."

      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: EVERY FAN'S DREAM ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="every-fans-dream">Copa Libertadores — Every Fan's Dream</h2>

        <p>There are tournaments, and then there is the Copa Libertadores. If European football has the Champions League as its crown jewel, South America has the Libertadores as its beating heart. But comparing them does both a disservice, because the Libertadores is not the South American Champions League. It is something entirely different — rawer, more unpredictable, more emotionally violent, and more deeply intertwined with identity, class, and national pride than any club competition on earth.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1960, the Copa Libertadores de America is the premier club competition organized by CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation. It brings together the best clubs from ten countries — Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela — plus occasional invitees from Mexico and other CONCACAF nations. The tournament runs from February through November, spanning nearly the entire calendar year, and its road from the preliminary rounds to the final is a marathon of logistics, emotion, and football at its most primal.</p>

        <p>What makes the Libertadores different from the Champions League? Everything. The distances are continental — a group stage draw can send your team from Buenos Aires to Barranquilla, from Santiago to Belo Horizonte, from Quito to Asuncion. The altitude changes are punishing — you might play at sea level in Montevideo one week and at 3,600 meters in La Paz the next. The atmospheres are volcanic. There are no corporate hospitality lounges filling half the stadium. The stands are packed with singing, jumping, flag-waving fans who have saved for months to be there. The away sections are smaller, louder, and more intense than anything you will experience in Europe. And the stakes feel higher, because for most South American clubs, winning the Libertadores is the single greatest achievement in their history.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"The Champions League is a spectacle. The Libertadores is a war. You don't watch it — you survive it." — Anonymous Argentine fan</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For a traveling fan, attending a Copa Libertadores match abroad is the ultimate away-day. It combines everything that makes football travel in Latin America extraordinary: long overnight bus rides through deserts and mountain passes, border crossings with unpredictable bureaucracy, cities you have never visited before, food you have never tasted, and an atmosphere inside the stadium that can only be described as otherworldly. If you have ever dreamed of following your team across the continent, the Libertadores is where that dream becomes real. And this guide will show you exactly how to make it happen.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: TOURNAMENT CALENDAR AND FORMAT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="calendar-format">Tournament Calendar and Format</h2>

        <p>Understanding the tournament's structure is essential for planning your travel. The Copa Libertadores has evolved significantly over the decades, and the current format — settled into its rhythm since the mid-2010s — follows a clear progression from preliminary phases through to a single-leg final. Here is how it breaks down and when you need to start planning for each stage.</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 1 — Preliminary Rounds (January-February):</strong> The tournament begins with qualifying rounds that whittle down smaller clubs and lower-ranked teams. These matches are played on a home-and-away basis across two legs. For traveling fans, these rounds are low-cost opportunities to see early Libertadores action, but the matchups tend to involve less prominent clubs and smaller stadiums. Planning can be done 2-3 weeks in advance since demand is low.</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 2 — Group Stage (April-May):</strong> This is where the tournament truly begins. Thirty-two teams are divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing six matches — three at home and three away. The group stage is the sweet spot for the traveling fan: tickets are more available, flights and buses are not yet inflated by knockout-round demand, and the variety of destinations is at its widest. You might follow your team to three different countries in six weeks. Start planning 4-6 weeks before the first group match, especially if your team draws a group with a Brazilian or Argentine giant.</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 3 — Round of 16 (July-August):</strong> Sixteen teams remain, playing home-and-away ties. The intensity jumps dramatically. Ticket demand rises, and prices for transport and accommodation in host cities increase noticeably. Plan at least 6-8 weeks ahead for this stage, and be ready to buy tickets within hours of them going on sale.</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 4 — Quarterfinals and Semifinals (August-October):</strong> This is where legends are made. Eight teams in the quarters, four in the semis. The atmosphere at these matches is among the most intense in all of football. Stadiums sell out, flights fill up, and hotel prices near the stadium can double or triple. If your team makes it this far, plan the moment the draw is made — do not wait.</p>

        <p><strong>Phase 5 — The Final (November):</strong> Since 2019, CONMEBOL has held the final as a single match at a pre-determined neutral venue (though this format has varied and may continue to evolve). The final is the hardest ticket in South American football. It is also the most expensive trip you will take as a fan. Start planning the logistics the moment your team qualifies for the semifinals, even before you know the final venue. Book refundable flights and hotels speculatively.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">CONMEBOL typically publishes the full group stage schedule 3-4 weeks before the first matchday. Bookmark the official CONMEBOL Libertadores website and set up Google Alerts for your team's name plus "Libertadores" so you never miss a schedule announcement. The moment dates and opponents are confirmed, lock in your transport and accommodation — prices only go up from there.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 3: HOW TO GET TICKETS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="tickets">How to Get Libertadores Tickets</h2>

        <p>Tickets are the single most critical — and most stressful — part of attending a Copa Libertadores match. The process is different from European football, where you can often buy directly from the host club's website with a credit card. In South America, the ticketing ecosystem is a mix of official channels, membership requirements, limited allocations, and a black market you need to avoid at all costs.</p>

        <p><strong>The CONMEBOL allocation system:</strong> For every Libertadores match, CONMEBOL mandates that the home club must allocate a percentage of the stadium capacity (typically 5% but at least 1,500 seats) to the visiting club's fans. The visiting club then distributes these tickets to its registered members, typically through its official website or physical box office. This means you almost always need to buy your away ticket through your own club, not through the host club or CONMEBOL directly.</p>

        <p><strong>Club membership is almost mandatory:</strong> In Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay especially, being a "socio" (paying member) of your club is practically required to access Libertadores tickets for away matches. The club prioritizes ticket sales to members with the longest tenure and best attendance records. If you are not a member, your chances of getting an official away ticket drop significantly. Our strong recommendation: if you are serious about following your team in the Libertadores, become a socio well before the tournament starts. Monthly fees range from 5 to 30 USD depending on the club and the membership tier.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical ticket prices by round:</strong></p>

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Buying home section tickets as a neutral:</strong> If you cannot get an away allocation through your club, another option is to buy a ticket in the home section. This requires being careful: you must not wear your visiting team's colors, you must not celebrate goals, and you must blend in completely. This approach works for group stage matches in larger stadiums where security is less intense, but it becomes extremely risky and inadvisable in knockout rounds and derbies. Use your judgment, and never put yourself in a situation where being identified as a visiting fan in the home section could lead to trouble.</p>

            WARNING: Ticket Scams in the Libertadores
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Scams are rampant during Libertadores season.</strong> Never buy tickets from strangers on social media, WhatsApp groups, or from street scalpers outside the stadium. The most common scams include: duplicate QR codes sold to multiple buyers (only the first person through the gate gets in), counterfeit physical tickets, tickets from previous rounds presented as current ones, and "guaranteed ticket" packages from unofficial travel agencies. If the price seems too good to be true, it is a scam. If someone is selling a semifinal ticket at face value on Instagram, it is a scam. Only buy through your club's official channels, the host club's authorized platforms, or CONMEBOL's official ticket portal for the final.

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: LOGISTICS BY TOURNAMENT PHASE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="logistics-by-phase">Logistics by Tournament Phase</h2>

        <p>The logistical challenge of following your team in the Libertadores changes dramatically depending on which phase of the tournament you are traveling for. A group stage match in a neighboring country is a fundamentally different trip from a semifinal leg three thousand kilometers away. Here is how to approach each phase.</p>

        <h3 id="group-stage-logistics">Group Stage</h3>

        <p>The group stage is the most accessible phase for the traveling fan and the best entry point if you have never attended a Libertadores match abroad. Your team plays three away matches over approximately two months, and the group draw determines your destinations. The trick is to plan selectively: unless you have unlimited time and money, pick the one or two away matches that make the most sense logistically and financially.</p>

        <p>For group stage matches, overnight buses are your best friend. If your team draws an opponent in a neighboring country — say, a Buenos Aires club traveling to Asuncion, or a Chilean club heading to Lima — the bus option saves you both money and a night's accommodation. Ticket availability is at its highest during the group stage, giving you a realistic chance of securing an away allocation even if you are a newer socio. Accommodation in the host city is generally affordable since group stage matches do not generate the same hotel demand as knockout rounds. Budget hostels and Airbnbs will be readily available at normal prices.</p>

        <p>Our advice for the group stage: travel for the away match against the biggest opponent in your group. If your team is drawn against Flamengo, River Plate, or Boca Juniors, that away match will be a once-in-a-lifetime atmosphere even if it is "just" a group game. The stadium will be full, the atmosphere will be electric, and the memory will last forever.</p>

        <h3 id="round-of-16-quarters">Round of 16 and Quarterfinals</h3>

        <p>Once the tournament enters knockout territory, everything intensifies. The stakes are higher, the atmospheres are fiercer, and the logistics become more complex. For the Round of 16 and quarterfinals, you are looking at one away match per round (since ties are decided over two legs). The draw is crucial — it determines whether you are taking a two-hour flight or an eighteen-hour bus.</p>

        <p>At this stage, you need to act fast. The moment the draw is announced, book your transport even before tickets go on sale. Use refundable flight options or flexible bus tickets if possible. Hotels near the stadium will start filling up within days of the draw, so secure accommodation immediately. For tickets, be logged into your club's member portal the second sales open — knockout round away allocations sell out in minutes, not hours.</p>

        <p>Security also tightens significantly in the knockout rounds. Police in the host city will establish designated routes for visiting fans, often including bus convoys from a central meeting point to the stadium. Follow these organized movements — they exist for your protection. Going rogue and trying to reach the stadium independently in a knockout Libertadores match is inadvisable.</p>

        <h3 id="semifinals">Semifinals</h3>

        <p>The Libertadores semifinals are, for many fans, the peak of the tournament. The four remaining clubs bring everything they have — financially, emotionally, and in terms of fan mobilization. If your team reaches the semifinals, you are likely looking at one of the biggest trips of your life.</p>

        <p>Plan for premium costs at this stage. Flights to the host city will be more expensive, especially if both clubs are from the same country (a Brazil-only semifinal fills every flight between the two cities). Hotels triple their prices near the stadium. Tickets become nearly impossible to get through normal channels — priority goes to the most senior socios. If you do not have a ticket by the time you travel, do not count on finding one at the stadium. It simply will not happen at face value.</p>

        <p>Many clubs organize official travel packages for the semifinals, including chartered buses or even chartered flights, ticket allocation, and group accommodation. These are often the best option: they guarantee you a ticket, transport you safely, and connect you with fellow fans for the entire trip. Check your club's official website and social media for these packages.</p>

        <h3 id="the-final">The Final</h3>

        <p>Since CONMEBOL moved to a single-match final format in 2019, the Libertadores final has become the most coveted ticket in South American football. The venue is announced months in advance, giving you time to plan — but the demand is staggering. CONMEBOL distributes tickets directly to both finalist clubs and sells a portion through its own platform. Each club typically receives 15,000-25,000 tickets depending on the venue capacity, which they then distribute to their socios.</p>

        <p>For the final, treat your trip planning like a military operation. Book refundable flights to the announced city as soon as your team qualifies for the semifinals. Reserve accommodation immediately — even if your team has not yet reached the final, the financial risk of a refundable booking is minimal compared to the risk of finding nothing available if they do qualify. Have your club membership up to date and your payment method ready for the instant ticket sales open. Consider traveling 2-3 days early to soak in the atmosphere and ensure you are settled before the match.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 5: CLASSIC LIBERTADORES ROUTES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="classic-routes">Classic Libertadores Routes</h2>

        <p>Certain routes come up again and again in the Copa Libertadores, connecting the continent's football powerhouses across borders and time zones. These are the corridors that every serious Libertadores traveler should know — with real costs, travel times, and the best way to navigate each one.</p>

        <p><strong>Buenos Aires to/from Sao Paulo:</strong> The heavyweight corridor of South American football. Argentine and Brazilian clubs meet frequently in the Libertadores, and Buenos Aires-Sao Paulo is the most common route. Direct flights take roughly 2.5-3 hours and cost between 100 and 300 USD round trip if booked early. There is no practical overland option — the bus takes upward of 30 hours. Once in Sao Paulo, the city's metro system can get you to most major stadiums (Arena Corinthians on Line 3-Red; Allianz Parque near Palmeiras station). Budget 2-3 nights in the city.</p>

        <p><strong>Bogota to/from Lima:</strong> A route that appears whenever Colombian clubs draw Peruvian opponents. Direct flights run about 3 hours and cost 120-250 USD round trip. There is no realistic overland option across the Colombia-Ecuador-Peru border chain for a football trip — the journey would take multiple days. Lima's airport is well-connected to the city center via the Jorge Chavez bus or taxi services. Estadio Monumental (Universitario) and Estadio Nacional are both reachable by public transport from Miraflores or downtown Lima.</p>

        <p><strong>Santiago to/from Buenos Aires:</strong> One of the most iconic cross-border routes in the continent. The direct flight takes about 2 hours and costs 80-200 USD round trip. The overland alternative is a spectacular 6-7 hour bus ride across the Andes via the Cristo Redentor pass, costing 25-50 USD one way — but be warned that the pass closes during winter storms (June-August), which can coincide with the group stage and Round of 16. If the pass is open and the weather is clear, this bus ride is one of the most beautiful journeys in South America.</p>

        <p><strong>Quito to/from Guayaquil:</strong> An intra-country route that matters enormously when Ecuadorian clubs are involved. The flight takes 45 minutes and costs 40-80 USD. The bus takes about 8 hours along the Pan-American Highway and costs 8-15 USD. For a Libertadores match, the bus is the practical choice for budget travelers. Quito's altitude (2,850 meters) is a significant factor — visiting fans arriving from sea-level cities like Guayaquil or foreign teams from lowland countries should arrive at least a day early to acclimatize.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 6: CROSSING BORDERS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="crossing-borders">Crossing Borders for the Libertadores</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores is, by definition, an international tournament, which means that following your team will almost certainly involve crossing at least one border. For Latin American fans, this is generally straightforward — but there are important details that can trip you up if you are unprepared.</p>

        <p><strong>Mercosur and CAN free movement:</strong> Citizens of Mercosur member states (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) and associate members (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia) can travel between member countries using just their national identity card (cedula or DNI) for stays of up to 90 days. You do not need a passport for most intra-South American travel if you are a citizen of one of these countries. However, we strongly recommend carrying your passport anyway — it speeds up border processing and serves as a universally recognized backup document.</p>

        <p><strong>Documents you should always carry:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Passport or national ID card</strong> — valid and not expired. Check the expiration date before you travel.</li>
          <li><strong>Match ticket or proof of purchase</strong> — some immigration officers at land borders will ask why you are entering the country. Having a ticket proves your purpose of travel.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of return transport</strong> — a return bus or flight ticket. Some border officials require evidence that you plan to leave the country.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of accommodation</strong> — a hotel reservation or the address of where you are staying.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel insurance</strong> — not always required by law, but highly recommended. It covers medical emergencies, theft, and trip cancellations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Land border crossings:</strong> If you are traveling by bus across borders — such as Buenos Aires to Asuncion, Santiago to Mendoza, or Lima to La Paz — the bus will stop at the border for immigration processing. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the border post and the volume of traffic. Have your documents ready and accessible. Keep valuables on your person, not in overhead storage. Some borders (like the Argentina-Paraguay crossing at Clorinda/Falcón) can be chaotic; stay calm and follow the instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>For non-South American passport holders:</strong> If you hold a passport from outside South America, you will need to check the specific visa requirements for each country you plan to visit. Citizens of the European Union, the United States, Canada, and most Central American countries can enter most South American nations visa-free for short stays (typically 90 days). However, some countries may require a visa depending on your nationality. Always check with the consulate or embassy of the destination country well before your trip.</p>

        <h2 id="budget">Budget for a Libertadores Trip</h2>

        <p>Money is the most practical consideration of any Libertadores adventure, and the costs vary enormously depending on the phase of the tournament, the route, and your travel style. Below, we break down realistic budgets for three types of travelers across different tournament phases. All figures are per person and include transport, ticket, accommodation, food, and miscellaneous expenses.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget tier breakdown:</strong> The budget traveler takes overnight buses (saving on accommodation), sleeps in hostels or fan houses, eats at street stalls and local markets, and buys the cheapest available ticket. This is how most young fans travel, and it is entirely doable across most of South America. The key is booking transport early and being flexible with comfort.</p>

        <p><strong>Mid-range tier breakdown:</strong> The mid-range traveler flies low-cost airlines, stays in a clean hotel or well-reviewed Airbnb, eats at local restaurants (not tourist traps), and buys a mid-tier ticket. This offers a good balance of comfort and affordability, and it is the most practical approach for fans with full-time jobs and limited vacation days who need to minimize travel time.</p>

        <p><strong>Premium tier breakdown:</strong> The premium traveler books full-service flights, stays in a hotel near the stadium, eats wherever they want, and may pay above face value for a ticket through authorized resale channels (not scalpers). This tier is common among older fans, family groups, and fans traveling from outside South America.</p>

A cama or semi-cama bus between neighboring capitals (Buenos Aires-Asuncion, Lima-La Paz, Santiago-Buenos Aires) costs a fraction of a flight and eliminates one night of accommodation. If you travel on the night before the match and return the night after, you can attend a Libertadores match abroad for the cost of two bus tickets, one night's accommodation, and the match ticket. Total: as low as $100-150 USD on budget routes.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 8: GREATEST FINALS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="greatest-finals">The Greatest Finals in History</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores final is where football becomes mythology. These are the matches that transcend sport, that become cultural events, that fans who were there will tell their grandchildren about. If you need motivation to start planning your Libertadores journey, these stories should provide it.</p>

        <h3>River Plate vs Boca Juniors — 2018</h3>

        <p>The most dramatic Libertadores final ever played, and possibly the most dramatic final in the history of club football. For the first time, the Superclasico — the fiercest rivalry in world football — was staged on the biggest continental stage. The first leg at La Bombonera ended 2-2 in a match of extraordinary tension. But it was the second leg that entered the history books. Scheduled at River's Estadio Monumental, the Boca team bus was attacked by River fans while approaching the stadium, with players injured by thrown objects and tear gas. The match was postponed, then postponed again, and ultimately CONMEBOL made the unprecedented decision to move the second leg to the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, Spain — 10,000 kilometers from Buenos Aires. River won 3-1 in extra time in Madrid, but the story of that final is not about the score. It is about the chaos, the passion, and the lengths fans were willing to go to be there, including crossing the Atlantic Ocean on 72 hours' notice.</p>

        <h3>Flamengo vs River Plate — 2019</h3>

        <p>The first single-match final in the modern format, held at the Estadio Monumental in Lima, Peru. River Plate took the lead through Rafael Santos Borre and seemed in complete control heading into stoppage time. Then Gabriel Barbosa — Gabigol — scored twice in the final three minutes to turn the match on its head, giving Flamengo a 2-1 victory and their first Libertadores title in 38 years. The scenes in Lima were extraordinary: over 25,000 Flamengo fans had traveled to Peru, turning the city into an extension of Rio de Janeiro. Back in Rio, an estimated four million people celebrated in the streets. This final demonstrated the sheer scale of mobilization that Brazilian clubs can achieve and cemented the single-venue final as a fan spectacle.</p>

        <h3>Palmeiras vs Santos — 2021</h3>

        <p>An all-Brazilian final played at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro during the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited fan attendance due to health restrictions. Despite the reduced crowd, the atmosphere was electric. Breno Lopes headed in the winning goal in the 99th minute to give Palmeiras a 1-0 victory and their second consecutive Libertadores title. For the thousands of Palmeiras fans who managed to attend under strict health protocols, it was a surreal experience — celebrating a historic victory while wearing masks and observing social distancing. This final is a reminder that Libertadores magic persists even under the most extraordinary circumstances.</p>

        <h3>Fluminense vs Boca Juniors — 2023</h3>

        <p>Held at the iconic Maracana, this final saw Fluminense claim their first-ever Copa Libertadores title with a 2-1 victory over Boca Juniors. The match was a fitting showcase of everything the tournament represents: a Brazilian club with a passionate but historically frustrated fanbase against an Argentine giant with the tournament in its DNA. Over 70,000 fans filled the Maracana, with thousands of Argentine fans making the journey to Rio despite the challenges. German Cano scored the winning goal, and the subsequent celebrations in Rio lasted for days. For the traveling Boca fans, the heartbreak was immense — but even they acknowledged that being at the Maracana for a Libertadores final was an experience they would never trade.</p>

                Visiting fan tickets are allocated by CONMEBOL to the visiting club, which then distributes them to its registered members (socios). You need to be a socio of your club and purchase through their official channels as soon as tickets go on sale — typically 2-4 weeks before the match. Knockout round tickets sell out within hours. If you are not a socio, your options are limited: you may be able to purchase a home section ticket through the host club (but you must not display visiting team colors) or use authorized resale platforms. Never buy from unofficial sellers on social media or outside the stadium.

                Most South American citizens can travel within the continent using just their national ID card (DNI or cedula) thanks to Mercosur and CAN agreements. No visa is required for stays under 90 days between member states. However, always carry your passport as a backup, along with proof of accommodation, return transport, and your match ticket. If you hold a passport from outside South America, check the specific visa requirements for the host country — most EU, US, and Canadian citizens can enter visa-free for short stays.

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              <span itemprop="name">How much does it cost to attend a Copa Libertadores match abroad?</span>

              <div class="faq-answer__inner" itemprop="text">
                Costs depend on the round, route, and your travel style. A budget group stage trip to a neighboring country costs $150-250 USD including overnight bus, hostel, ticket, and food. Knockout rounds run $300-700 USD on a budget as ticket and transport prices increase. A Libertadores final can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000+ depending on how early you book, whether you fly or take a bus, and where you stay. The biggest variable is always transport — booking flights 4-6 weeks early with low-cost carriers like JetSMART or SKY can save you hundreds of dollars. Overnight buses remain the most affordable option for routes under 20 hours.

              <div class="faq-answer__inner" itemprop="text">
                Yes, with proper preparation. Thousands of fans travel safely across South America for Libertadores matches every year. The fundamentals: travel in groups, research the host city's safe neighborhoods beforehand, follow police instructions on matchday, use ride-hailing apps instead of street taxis, and keep your team's jersey in your bag outside the immediate stadium area. In knockout rounds, CONMEBOL and local police provide designated zones and escort routes for visiting fans — always use them. Keep valuables at your accommodation, carry only the cash you need for the day, share your live location with someone you trust, and have a clear exit plan before entering the stadium. Preparation eliminates most risks.
