    <article class="guide-body">

      <!-- ===== WHAT IS THE ÍNDICE HINCHA? ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">What Is the Índice Hincha&#8482;?</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">There are hundreds of systems for rating football leagues, ranking players, measuring team strength, and predicting match outcomes. None of them answer the question that actually matters to a traveling fan: <strong>what will it feel like to be there?</strong> The Índice Hincha was born to fill that gap. It is the first and only editorial scoring system designed exclusively to measure the experience of attending a football match as a visiting fan, from the moment you arrive in the city to the moment you leave the stadium.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The name itself is a statement of intent. "Índice" means index or score. "Hincha" is the word for a passionate football fan across all of Latin America, a word with more weight and cultural baggage than "supporter" or "fan" could ever carry. A hincha does not simply watch football. A hincha lives it, breathes it, travels for it, sacrifices for it. The Índice Hincha was built for that person.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The system operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A score of 1 represents a match with virtually no experiential value for a traveling fan: empty stands, no history between the teams, nothing to do in the city, and logistical barriers that make the trip pointless. A score of 100 represents the theoretical perfect experience: volcanic atmosphere, a century-old rivalry dripping with cultural significance, an electric pre-match buildup, easy logistics, safe surroundings, and a city that enriches the experience far beyond the ninety minutes of play. No match has ever scored a perfect 100, but the Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate came close at 97.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The critical distinction is this: <strong>the Índice Hincha measures experience, not football quality.</strong> A League One promotion playoff in England might produce better tactical football than a clásico between two mid-table teams in Paraguay, but the experience of attending the Paraguayan derby, with its deafening drums, its history of class tension, its choripán-scented pre-match atmosphere, and the volcanic intensity of forty thousand people who have waited all year for this match, will almost certainly score higher. The Índice Hincha does not care who wins or how well they play. It cares about what you feel, what you see, what you hear, and what you take home in your memory.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Every score published on HinchaViajero is the product of research that combines firsthand stadium visits, structured interviews with local and traveling fans, official data from clubs and federations, transport and safety infrastructure analysis, and editorial judgment from our team of traveling fans spread across the continent. The Índice Hincha is not generated by an algorithm. It is not crowdsourced. It is an editorial product, which means every score carries the weight of a considered opinion backed by evidence. We stand behind every number we publish.</p>

             loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>The Índice Hincha measures the total experience of being inside a stadium like this, from the acoustics and proximity to the pitch to the choreographies in the stands and the emotion of the rivalry itself.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- ===== THE 6 PILLARS ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The 6 Pillars of the Índice Hincha&#8482;</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Índice Hincha is built on six distinct pillars, each measuring a different dimension of the fan experience. Each pillar receives a sub-score from 1 to 100, and the final Índice Hincha score is calculated as a weighted average of all six. The weights reflect our editorial conviction about what matters most to a traveling fan. Below, we break down each pillar in detail: what it measures, why it matters, and how we evaluate it.</p>

      <!-- Pillar 1 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">1. Rivalry Intensity (25%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--high">
          <span>Weight: 25%</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">This is the single most important pillar and the one that carries the greatest weight. Rivalry Intensity measures the depth, history, and cultural significance of the conflict between the two teams. It is the pillar that separates a forgettable league fixture from a match that will burn itself into your memory forever.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We evaluate Rivalry Intensity across several dimensions. <strong>Historical depth</strong> considers how long the teams have been facing each other and how many defining moments (finals, relegations, controversial incidents) punctuate that history. Boca vs River, with over a century of history including a Copa Libertadores final that had to be moved to another continent, scores near-perfect here. <strong>Cultural weight</strong> examines whether the rivalry reflects broader social tensions: class, geography, ethnicity, politics. Nacional vs Peñarol in Uruguay is a rivalry that has divided a small nation since 1900 along lines that mirror the country's founding tensions. <strong>Stakes</strong> looks at what is typically on the line when these teams meet: are they perennial contenders who regularly face each other in finals, or do they rarely compete for the same prize? <strong>Fan perception</strong> captures how the rivalry is felt by the people who live it, gathered through interviews and testimonials from fans on both sides.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A high Rivalry Intensity score means you are walking into a match where the tension is palpable from the moment you step off the bus, where every fan in the city has an opinion and a stake, and where the atmosphere inside the stadium will be supercharged by decades or centuries of accumulated passion. This pillar is weighted at 25% because, in our experience, no amount of beautiful architecture or convenient logistics can compensate for a rivalry that simply does not matter.</p>

      <!-- Pillar 2 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">2. Stadium Atmosphere (20%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--high">
          <span>Weight: 20%</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Stadium Atmosphere evaluates the sensory experience of being inside the ground on matchday. This is where the architecture of the stadium meets the culture of the fans, and the result is either a spine-tingling cauldron of noise and color or a soulless concrete bowl where you can hear individual conversations three rows away.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We assess <strong>capacity and occupancy rate</strong>: a 50,000-seat stadium that regularly fills to 95% will outscore an 80,000-seat venue that averages 40% attendance, because atmosphere is about density, not size. <strong>Acoustic design</strong> matters enormously: enclosed stadiums with steep stands and roofs that trap sound (like La Bombonera) create a wall of noise that open-air bowls cannot match. <strong>Tifo culture</strong> evaluates the choreographies, banners, flags, confetti, and pyrotechnics that the fans produce for big matches, which in South America can involve months of preparation and thousands of dollars in materials. <strong>Proximity to the pitch</strong> affects how connected you feel to the action: stadiums without running tracks where the first row is five meters from the touchline create an intimacy that is transformative. <strong>Sustained energy</strong> looks at whether the fans sing for ninety minutes or only when a goal goes in.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A perfect Atmosphere score describes La Bombonera on the night of a Superclásico: the concrete literally vibrating under your feet, fifty-four thousand voices singing in unison, confetti falling like snow, drums that have not stopped since two hours before kickoff, and an acoustic environment so intense that opposition players have described it as physically disorienting. That is what 98 out of 100 sounds like.</p>

      <!-- Pillar 3 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">3. Pre-Match Experience (15%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--medium">
          <span>Weight: 15%</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">In Latin America, the match does not begin at kickoff. It begins hours, sometimes days, before. The pre-match experience, known as "la previa," is a cultural ritual that is inseparable from the matchday itself. This pillar measures the quality, accessibility, and atmosphere of everything that happens before you walk through the turnstile.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We evaluate the <strong>quality of fan gathering zones</strong>: are there bars, plazas, or streets near the stadium where fans congregate hours before the match? In Buenos Aires, the streets around La Bombonera transform into an open-air festival of grilled choripán, beer, drums, and singing that is an event in itself. In Montevideo, the asado before the clásico is a sacred institution. <strong>Food and drink culture</strong> around the stadium is assessed: the choripán in Buenos Aires, the tacos outside the Azteca, the ceviche carts near Matute in Lima. <strong>Organized activities</strong> like fan marches to the stadium, coordinated flag displays on the streets, and barra gatherings at designated bars all contribute. <strong>Accessibility for visiting fans</strong> asks whether there are safe and welcoming spaces for away supporters to enjoy the pre-match, or whether the pre-match environment is hostile to outsiders.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A high Pre-Match Experience score means the hours before the match are as memorable as the match itself. It means you will eat extraordinary food, hear songs that give you goosebumps, and feel the tension build organically in a way that makes the moment you enter the stadium feel like a crescendo, not a cold start.</p>

             loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>The pre-match experience and in-stadium choreographies are central to the Índice Hincha. In South America, the fans are not spectators; they are performers, and the stands are their stage.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- Pillar 4 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">4. Logistical Accessibility (15%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--medium">
          <span>Weight: 15%</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">You can have the most intense rivalry and the most electric stadium in the world, but if a traveling fan cannot actually get there, it does not matter. Logistical Accessibility measures how easy or difficult it is for a visiting fan to plan and execute the trip, from the moment they decide to go to the moment they arrive at the stadium gate.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">This pillar considers <strong>transport options</strong>: is the city served by international flights? Are there bus routes from neighboring countries? How well does the local transport network connect the city center and airport to the stadium? <strong>Cost of travel</strong> factors in average flight and bus prices, accommodation costs, and matchday expenses. <strong>Ticket accessibility</strong> evaluates how easy it is for a non-member or foreign fan to get a ticket: some clubs sell openly through Ticketmaster or equivalent platforms, while others restrict sales to members only, making access nearly impossible for outsiders. <strong>Border considerations</strong> are critical for international trips: visa requirements, border crossing complexity, and currency exchange ease all factor in. <strong>Infrastructure quality</strong> covers the basics: can you find reasonable accommodation near the stadium, is there reliable internet for navigation and ride-hailing apps, and do payment systems work for foreigners?</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Montevideo scores exceptionally well on this pillar. Flights and buses connect it easily to Buenos Aires and São Paulo. The stadiums are centrally located. Tickets are relatively easy to buy. The city is walkable, affordable, and welcoming to foreigners. On the other end of the spectrum, attending certain matches in remote Bolivian cities requires significant logistical planning, altitude acclimatization, and tolerance for limited infrastructure.</p>

      <!-- Pillar 5 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">5. Visitor Safety (15%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--medium">
          <span>Weight: 15%</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Safety is a non-negotiable consideration for any traveling fan, and this pillar exists to give it the weight it deserves. Visitor Safety measures the overall safety environment that a traveling fan can expect, from the neighborhood around the stadium to the security protocols inside the ground to the broader safety profile of the city.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">We assess <strong>historical safety record</strong>: has the match or the stadium seen violent incidents involving fans in recent years? Are there documented patterns of theft, assault, or confrontation in the areas surrounding the ground? <strong>Security infrastructure</strong> evaluates the quality and professionalism of the police and private security operations on matchday: is the security presence reassuring or itself a source of tension? In some countries, heavy-handed policing can create more danger than it prevents. <strong>Neighborhood profile</strong> looks at the specific areas around the stadium: are they safe to walk through before and after the match, or do they require caution? La Boca in Buenos Aires, for example, is atmospheric but requires street-smart navigation, especially after dark. <strong>Away-fan treatment</strong> examines how visiting supporters are handled by the authorities and by the home crowd: in some contexts, away fans are escorted by police and kept in dedicated sections, while in others, visiting fan sections have been eliminated entirely for safety reasons.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A high Visitor Safety score does not mean the match is sterile or devoid of intensity. It means a well-prepared traveling fan can enjoy the experience without unreasonable risk. The safest derbies on the continent, like those in Montevideo and Santiago, still deliver enormous passion and atmosphere while maintaining conditions that allow fans to arrive and leave without incident.</p>

      <!-- Pillar 6 -->
      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">6. Cultural Value (10%)</h3>

      <div class="animate-on-scroll" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
        <div class="indice-hincha indice-hincha--low">
          <span>Weight: 10%</span>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A truly great away-day does not begin and end at the stadium. Cultural Value measures what the destination city offers beyond the match itself, recognizing that the best football trips are those where the city enriches the experience and gives you reasons to stay an extra day or two.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">This pillar evaluates <strong>city attractions</strong>: are there museums, landmarks, neighborhoods, and natural sights worth exploring? <strong>Historical significance</strong> considers whether the city itself has a story that connects to the broader football culture: Buenos Aires has a football museum, murals dedicated to Maradona, and barrios where football history lives on every corner. <strong>Gastronomy</strong> is a major factor, because food is inseparable from the Latin American football experience: the asado culture in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, the ceviche in Lima, the tacos in Mexico City, the acarajé in Salvador. <strong>Nightlife and social scene</strong> matters for fans who want to celebrate after the match or connect with local supporters over drinks. <strong>Affordability</strong> assesses whether the city is accessible for travelers on different budgets.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">This pillar carries the lowest weight at 10% because, ultimately, the Índice Hincha is about the match experience. But a destination like Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, or Mexico City adds so much to the trip that it would be a disservice not to factor it in. A match in a world-class city with incredible food, nightlife, and cultural offerings will always score higher than the same match in an isolated town with nothing else to do.</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--tip animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">Why these 6 pillars and not others?</div>
        <p class="info-box__text">We tested dozens of possible dimensions before settling on these six. Factors like "weather" and "pitch quality" were eliminated because they do not meaningfully affect the fan experience for a traveling supporter. "Broadcasting quality" was removed because the Índice Hincha is about being there, not watching from home. The six pillars that survived our testing are the ones that, based on hundreds of fan interviews and our own travel experience, consistently determine whether a trip is remembered as legendary or forgettable.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- ===== HOW IT'S CALCULATED ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">How It's Calculated — The Formula</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The final Índice Hincha score is calculated as a weighted average of the six pillar sub-scores. Each pillar receives a score from 1 to 100, and the weighted formula is applied as follows:</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--warning animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">The Índice Hincha&#8482; Formula</div>
        <p class="info-box__text" style="font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: var(--text-base); letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 2;">
          <strong>IH = (R &times; 0.25) + (A &times; 0.20) + (P &times; 0.15) + (L &times; 0.15) + (S &times; 0.15) + (C &times; 0.10)</strong><br><br>
          Where:<br>
          R = Rivalry Intensity (25%)<br>
          A = Stadium Atmosphere (20%)<br>
          P = Pre-Match Experience (15%)<br>
          L = Logistical Accessibility (15%)<br>
          S = Visitor Safety (15%)<br>
          C = Cultural Value (10%)
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The weights are not arbitrary. They reflect a deliberate editorial position: Rivalry Intensity is the foundation of any great matchday experience, which is why it carries the highest weight at 25%. Stadium Atmosphere is the second most important factor because it determines the sensory reality of the ninety minutes you spend inside the ground. The remaining four pillars are equally weighted at 15% each (with Cultural Value slightly lower at 10%) because they represent the practical and contextual dimensions that determine whether the overall trip, not just the match, is worth the investment of time and money.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Worked Example: Boca vs River (Superclásico)</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll"><strong>Final Score:</strong> 24.75 + 19.60 + 14.25 + 13.20 + 12.75 + 9.60 = <strong>94.15, rounded to 97 after editorial adjustment.</strong></p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The editorial adjustment is an important detail. The raw weighted average produces a mathematical result, but the final published score includes a small editorial correction (never more than 5 points in either direction) that accounts for intangible factors that no formula can fully capture. In the case of the Superclásico, the editorial adjustment reflects the consensus among our team and dozens of interviewed fans that the experience of La Bombonera on the night of a Boca-River transcends what any combination of sub-scores can express. The raw score already placed it in Legendary territory; the adjustment simply fine-tunes the final number to reflect the full weight of the experience.</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--tip animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">Understanding the weight distribution</div>
        <p class="info-box__text">The weights are designed so that a match can score high even if one pillar is weak, as long as the other pillars compensate. A derby with extraordinary Rivalry Intensity and Atmosphere but mediocre Logistical Accessibility (like a match in a remote Bolivian city) can still score in the 70s or low 80s if the experiential pillars are strong enough. Conversely, a match that is easy to reach, perfectly safe, and in a beautiful city but between teams with no meaningful rivalry will never crack the top tier, because Rivalry Intensity and Atmosphere together account for 45% of the score.</p>

      <!-- ===== INTERPRETATION SCALE ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Interpretation Scale</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Every Índice Hincha score maps to one of six categories. These categories are not just labels; they carry specific meaning about what kind of experience a traveling fan can expect. Below is the complete interpretation scale with the visual badges used throughout HinchaViajero.</p>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The category boundaries are not arbitrary cutoffs. They reflect meaningful breaks in the quality of experience. The jump from 74 (top of Recommended) to 75 (bottom of Epic) represents the threshold where a match transitions from "great if you happen to be nearby" to "worth buying a plane ticket for." The jump from 89 to 90 marks the entry into Legendary territory, which is reserved for the absolute elite: matches where the combination of rivalry, atmosphere, and context creates something that cannot be replicated anywhere else on the planet.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">In practice, most derbies on the continent fall in the Recommended to Epic range (60-89). Only a handful of matches have ever scored above 90, and they are the ones that appear on every traveling fan's bucket list. At the other end, scores below 40 are rare in our published rankings because we generally do not dedicate editorial resources to matches that would not interest a traveling fan. However, the full 1-100 scale exists because the Índice Hincha is designed to be comprehensive: if we score it, you can trust that the number tells you exactly what to expect.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">A few observations worth noting. The top four spots are occupied by derbies in four different countries, which reflects the continental breadth of elite matchday experiences in Latin America. Argentina and Brazil each place three derbies in the top 15, consistent with their depth of football culture and the size of their club systems. The presence of derbies from Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Colombia demonstrates that world-class fan experiences are not exclusive to the traditional football powerhouses.</p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The gap between first and second place (97 to 91) is the largest gap between consecutive rankings in the entire table, which underscores the singular status of the Superclásico. The clustering in the 76-88 range (positions 4 through 11) shows that there is a rich middle tier of derbies that all deliver exceptional experiences, with the differences between them coming down to nuances in individual pillars rather than dramatic gaps in overall quality.</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--warning animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">Scores are for the derby, not the venue</div>
        <p class="info-box__text">The Índice Hincha scores in this table rate the specific derby experience, not the stadium or city in general. A regular Flamengo league match against a bottom-table team would score significantly lower than the Fla-Flu, even though it takes place in the same Maracanã.

      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">Índice Hincha&#8482; by Tournament</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Índice Hincha is not limited to domestic derbies. We also apply the system to major tournament matches, where the context and stakes can elevate the fan experience to heights that regular league fixtures rarely reach. Below are the scoring ranges we assign to different tournament contexts, based on historical analysis and our direct experience attending these events.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Copa Libertadores Final — 95+</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Copa Libertadores Final is the pinnacle of South American club football, and attending one in person is the single most intense experience available to a traveling fan on the continent. Since 2019, the final has been played as a single match at a neutral venue, which means two massive traveling fan bases converge on one city, creating an atmosphere of sustained, city-wide intensity that starts days before kickoff and does not let up until long after the final whistle. The sheer volume of traveling fans, the stakes of the match, the continental spotlight, and the cultural significance of the Libertadores in South American life combine to produce an experience that consistently scores 95 or above on the Índice Hincha. If you attend only one football match in your lifetime, this should be on your shortlist.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Copa Sudamericana Final — 80+</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Copa Sudamericana is South America's second continental club competition, and while it does not carry the cultural weight of the Libertadores, its final has grown significantly in prestige and atmosphere over the past decade. Since adopting the single-match final format, the Sudamericana Final has delivered some extraordinary fan experiences, particularly when the finalists come from countries with strong traveling fan cultures. The atmosphere is a tier below the Libertadores but still firmly in Epic territory. Scores typically range from 80 to 88 depending on the specific matchup and venue.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Domestic League Finals — 75 to 92</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Domestic league finals vary enormously in their Índice Hincha scores because they depend heavily on which teams are playing and in which country the final takes place. An Argentine league final between Boca and River would score in the low 90s, matching or exceeding some Libertadores finals, because the Rivalry Intensity and Atmosphere pillars are already at maximum. A league final between two smaller teams in a smaller market might score in the mid-70s. The key variables are the prestige of the rivalry and whether the final is played over two legs (which distributes the atmosphere) or a single match (which concentrates it). In general, countries that have adopted the single-match final format, such as Brazil with its Supercopa, tend to produce higher Índice Hincha scores for their showpiece events.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Promotion and Relegation Matches — 70 to 90</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Here is where the Índice Hincha reveals something that traditional football ratings completely miss. A promotion playoff between two second-division teams can produce an atmosphere that rivals a Libertadores final, because the stakes are existential. When a club is fighting to return to the first division after years in the wilderness, the passion of the fans is volcanic and desperate in a way that routine league matches simply cannot replicate. The same applies to relegation deciders: the fear of dropping a division generates a raw emotional energy that is unlike anything else in football. These matches can score as high as 90 when the rivalry is meaningful, the stadium is full, and the stakes are maximum. They are among the most underrated experiences on the continent for a traveling fan, and the Índice Hincha is designed to surface exactly this kind of hidden gem.</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--tip animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">Tournament context amplifies everything</div>
        <p class="info-box__text">A regular league meeting between Palmeiras and Corinthians might score 86. The same fixture as a Copa Libertadores semifinal could score 93+. Tournament context acts as a multiplier on the Rivalry Intensity and Stadium Atmosphere pillars because the stakes increase dramatically. When we score a specific match (rather than a derby in general), we always account for the tournament context in which it takes place.</p>

      <!-- ===== HOW TO USE IT ===== -->
      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">How to Use the Índice Hincha&#8482; to Plan Your Trip</h2>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Índice Hincha is not just a rating for its own sake. It is a practical decision-making tool designed to help you allocate your most precious resources, time and money, toward the matches that will deliver the greatest return in terms of experience and memory. Here is a framework for using it effectively.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Step 1: Define Your Priority</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Not every traveling fan wants the same thing. Some are atmosphere chasers who want the loudest, most intense experience possible, regardless of cost or logistical difficulty. Others are first-timers who want a great experience without excessive risk or complexity. Still others are on a tight budget and need to maximize value. The Índice Hincha accommodates all of these profiles because you can look beyond the headline score and examine the individual pillar scores.</p>

      <ul class="animate-on-scroll">
        <li><strong>Atmosphere chaser:</strong> Filter for derbies where Rivalry Intensity and Stadium Atmosphere both score 90+. Accept lower scores on Logistics and Safety. Target: Boca vs River, Fla-Flu, Palmeiras vs Corinthians.</li>
        <li><strong>First-timer:</strong> Prioritize derbies where Visitor Safety and Logistical Accessibility score 80+, even if overall Índice Hincha is slightly lower. Target: Nacional vs Peñarol, Colo-Colo vs U de Chile, América vs Chivas.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget traveler:</strong> Cross-reference the Índice Hincha score with the estimated trip cost (published in our derby guides) to identify the best value. Target: Nacional vs Peñarol in Montevideo, Olimpia vs Cerro Porteño in Asunción, Atlas vs Chivas in Guadalajara.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural explorer:</strong> Look for derbies where Cultural Value scores 85+ and combine the match with a multi-day city exploration. Target: Fla-Flu in Rio de Janeiro, América vs Chivas in Mexico City, Alianza vs Universitario in Lima.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Step 2: Calculate Your Value-Per-Point Ratio</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">One of the most powerful uses of the Índice Hincha is calculating the cost-effectiveness of a trip. Divide the total estimated cost of your trip (flights, accommodation, tickets, food, transport) by the Índice Hincha score of the match you are attending. The result is your cost per Índice Hincha point, and it lets you compare trips on equal footing.</p>

      <div class="info-box info-box--tip animate-on-scroll">
        <div class="info-box__title">Value-per-point example</div>
        <p class="info-box__text"><strong>Trip A:</strong> Boca vs River in Buenos Aires. Total cost: $600 USD. Índice Hincha: 97. Cost per point: $6.19.<br><strong>Trip B:</strong> Nacional vs Peñarol in Montevideo. Total cost: $350 USD. Índice Hincha: 88. Cost per point: $3.98.<br><strong>Trip C:</strong> Olimpia vs Cerro Porteño in Asunción. Total cost: $200 USD. Índice Hincha: 74. Cost per point: $2.70.<br><br>Trip C delivers the most experience per dollar, but Trip A delivers the highest absolute experience. Trip B strikes the best balance between cost and intensity. Your choice depends on whether you are optimizing for value or for the peak experience.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Step 3: Check Seasonal Timing</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">Not all derbies are created equal across the calendar year. A Boca vs River in the opening rounds of the league season will still be electric, but the same fixture as a semifinal or final will be on another level entirely. Use the Índice Hincha score as a baseline and then check our match calendar for information about when the fixture falls in the season and what stakes are attached. As a rule of thumb, derbies played in the final third of the season or in knockout tournament stages deliver 10-15% more atmosphere than the same fixture earlier in the campaign.</p>

      <h3 class="animate-on-scroll">Step 4: Read the Full Derby Guide</h3>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Índice Hincha score tells you whether a trip is worth taking. The full derby guide on HinchaViajero tells you how to take it. Every scored derby has a dedicated guide with detailed information on tickets, transport, accommodation, safety zones, pre-match spots, costs, and insider tips. The Índice Hincha gets you to the decision. The guide gets you to the stadium.</p>

              The Índice Hincha is the first scoring system designed exclusively to measure the experience of attending a football match as a traveling fan, not the quality of the football itself. It rates matches on a 1-100 scale across six pillars: Rivalry Intensity (25%), Stadium Atmosphere (20%), Pre-Match Experience (15%), Logistical Accessibility (15%), Visitor Safety (15%), and Cultural Value (10%). Unlike conventional football ratings that focus on player performance or league quality, the Índice Hincha evaluates what matters to a fan who is planning a trip: will the atmosphere blow my mind, can I actually get there, and is it safe? Every score is the result of stadium visits, fan interviews, data analysis, and editorial judgment from our team of traveling fans.

              The Superclásico between Boca Juniors and River Plate in Buenos Aires, Argentina holds the highest Índice Hincha score at 97 out of 100, placing it in the Legendary category. It scores near-perfect marks on Rivalry Intensity (99) and Stadium Atmosphere (98), with La Bombonera's compact structure creating an acoustic and emotional experience unmatched anywhere on the planet. The Fla-Flu (Flamengo vs Fluminense) in Rio de Janeiro comes second with 91, followed by América vs Chivas (89) and Nacional vs Peñarol (88). Only two derbies have ever scored above 90, making the Legendary category an extremely exclusive tier.

              Yes. The Índice Hincha is a living editorial system that is re-evaluated periodically. Scores can change due to stadium renovations (which affect the Atmosphere pillar), changes in transport infrastructure (Logistical Accessibility), evolving safety conditions, or shifts in the cultural landscape surrounding a match. For example, River Plate's Monumental stadium renovation completed in 2023 improved the Atmosphere sub-score for any match played there. Conversely, a deterioration in neighborhood safety or a policy change that bans away fans can lower the relevant sub-scores. We conduct a full review of every scored match at least once per calendar year and publish updated scores whenever a material change occurs.

              Use the Índice Hincha as a decision framework by cross-referencing the overall score with your personal priorities and budget. If atmosphere is your top priority, filter for derbies with high Rivalry Intensity and Stadium Atmosphere sub-scores. If you are a first-timer, prioritize matches with high Logistical Accessibility and Visitor Safety scores. To maximize value, calculate your cost-per-point ratio: divide the total trip cost by the Índice Hincha score. A trip to Montevideo for Nacional vs Peñarol (88 points, approximately $350 USD) yields a cost-per-point of $3.98, making it one of the best value trips on the continent. Always pair the Índice Hincha score with our full derby guide for detailed logistics, tickets, and safety information.
