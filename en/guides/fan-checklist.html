A long bus ride with no outlets will drain your battery before you even arrive. A fully charged power bank with at least 10,000 mAh capacity ensures your phone survives the entire trip. This is one of the most commonly forgotten items and one of the most regretted when left behind."

      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: WHY YOU NEED A CHECKLIST ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="why-checklist">Why You Need a Checklist</h2>

        <p>Every experienced traveling fan has a story about the thing they forgot. The phone charger that was sitting on the kitchen counter. The match ticket that was on the printer but never made it into the bag. The passport that was in yesterday's jacket. These are not rookie mistakes -- they happen to seasoned travelers who get caught up in the excitement of departure and skip the basics.</p>

        <p>An away-day is not a regular trip. You are often leaving at odd hours, traveling through unfamiliar cities, arriving at crowded stadiums with strict entry rules, and navigating areas where losing your phone or running out of cash is more than an inconvenience -- it can derail the entire experience. A proper checklist eliminates the guesswork. You run through it once before you leave, and you travel with the confidence that nothing essential was left behind.</p>

        <p>This checklist is organized into five categories. Each one covers a different dimension of away-day preparation. Print it, screenshot it, bookmark it -- whatever works for you. The goal is simple: arrive at the stadium with everything you need so that the only thing on your mind is the match.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"I've done over 40 away-days across South America. I still use a checklist every single time. Not because I can't remember -- because the one time I trusted my memory, I left my ID at home and missed the bus."</p>
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: DOCUMENTS AND MONEY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="documents-money">Documents and Money</h2>

        <p>Documents and money are the non-negotiable foundation of every away-day. Forget your sunglasses and you squint for 90 minutes. Forget your ID and you do not travel at all. This category deserves the most attention because the consequences of getting it wrong are the most severe.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>National ID or Passport (original + photocopy).</strong> This is item number one, no exceptions. You need it to board buses and domestic flights, check into accommodation, and in many countries to enter the stadium. Carry the original on your person and keep a physical photocopy in a separate pocket or compartment of your bag.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital copy saved on your phone.</strong> Take a clear photo or scan of your ID/passport and save it in your phone's gallery and in cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, or email it to yourself). If the physical document is lost or stolen, the digital copy can help at police stations, embassies, and accommodation check-ins.</li>
          <li><strong>Health insurance card.</strong> If you have travel insurance or health coverage that works outside your home city, carry the card or a printout of your policy number and emergency contact line. Medical emergencies abroad without proof of insurance can be extremely expensive and stressful.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash in local currency.</strong> Calculate your expected spending: transport to and from the stadium, match ticket (if buying at the box office), food and drinks, plus a 20% buffer for unexpected expenses. Many street vendors, small buses, and informal sellers around stadiums only accept cash. ATMs near stadiums are often out of service or have long queues on matchday.</li>
          <li><strong>Debit or credit card as backup.</strong> Do not rely on cards as your primary payment method -- rely on cash. But carry a card for emergencies, hotel deposits, or larger purchases. Notify your bank before traveling internationally to avoid blocks on your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Accommodation booking confirmation (digital + printed).</strong> Save your booking confirmation as a PDF on your phone and print a paper copy. Wi-Fi and mobile data are not guaranteed at check-in, and some hostels or budget hotels want to see a physical confirmation.</li>
          <li><strong>Match ticket (digital + screenshot + printed if possible).</strong> If your ticket is digital, take a screenshot of the QR code or barcode and save it to your phone's gallery -- do not rely on the ticketing app loading at the stadium gate where signal is often congested. If you can print the ticket, do so. Belt and suspenders: digital, screenshot, and paper.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
          <div class="info-box__title">
            <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"/><line x1="12" y1="16" x2="12" y2="12"/><line x1="12" y1="8" x2="12.01" y2="8"/></svg>
            Leave Originals at Your Accommodation
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are staying at a hotel or hostel before the match, leave your passport original locked in reception's safe or in your locker and carry only the photocopy to the stadium. Stadiums are crowded, pickpocket-prone environments, and replacing a lost passport in a foreign country is a multi-day bureaucratic nightmare. The photocopy plus your digital scan is sufficient identification for the few hours you are at the match.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 3: CLOTHING AND LUGGAGE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="clothing-luggage">Clothing and Luggage</h2>

        <p>How you dress and what you carry on an away-day matters more than most fans realize. The wrong bag slows you down. The wrong shoes destroy your feet. The wrong clothing choices can attract unwanted attention in the wrong neighborhood. Here is what experienced traveling fans pack -- and what they deliberately leave at home.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Small backpack (no large suitcase).</strong> A 25-40 liter backpack is the ideal away-day bag. It fits as a personal item on buses and low-cost flights, stays on your back in crowded streets, and can be placed under your seat or between your feet inside the stadium. Rolling suitcases are impractical on uneven sidewalks, impossible to manage in stadium crowds, and signal "tourist" from a block away.</li>
          <li><strong>Team jersey (in the backpack, not worn until you arrive).</strong> Carry your jersey folded inside your bag and change into it when you reach the stadium area or when you link up with your group of fellow supporters. Wearing team colors on public transport or through unfamiliar neighborhoods -- especially for rivalry matches -- can attract unwanted attention. Travel neutral, arrive loud.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfortable, discreet clothes for travel.</strong> Neutral colors, nothing flashy, nothing that identifies your club or makes you stand out. Dark jeans or comfortable trousers, a plain t-shirt or hoodie, and a light jacket. You want to blend in, not stand out. This is especially important in cities where you do not know the local dynamics between fan groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Light waterproof jacket.</strong> Weather changes fast, especially in coastal and mountain cities across Latin America. A compact, packable rain jacket takes up almost no space in your bag and saves you from a miserable 90 minutes if rain hits. Standing in an open terrace in a downpour without a jacket is an experience you only need once.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfortable, broken-in shoes (never new ones).</strong> You will walk more than you think: from the bus terminal to your hostel, from the hostel to the stadium, standing for the entire match, walking back after the final whistle. Wear shoes you have already broken in. New shoes guarantee blisters by halftime. Sneakers or light hiking shoes with good grip are ideal -- you may need traction on wet concrete stairs inside the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Plastic bag for dirty clothes.</strong> A simple grocery bag weighs nothing and keeps your worn clothes, sweaty jersey, and muddy shoes separate from the clean items in your backpack. This small detail keeps your entire bag from smelling like a locker room on the return trip.</li>
          <li><strong>Compact microfiber towel for hostel stays.</strong> Many budget hostels and some Airbnbs do not provide towels, or charge extra for them. A microfiber travel towel dries fast, packs small, and solves the problem completely. If your accommodation includes towels, it still works as a sweat towel at the stadium on hot days.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: TECH AND COMMUNICATION ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="tech-communication">Tech and Communication</h2>

        <p>Your phone is your most versatile tool on an away-day. It is your map, your taxi, your ticket, your translator, and your emergency lifeline. But a dead phone is a useless phone, and an unprepared phone is almost as bad. Here is how to make sure your tech setup is match-ready before you leave.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phone charged to 100%.</strong> Start the day with a full charge. This sounds obvious, but the number of fans who leave the house at 60% and are at 15% by the time they reach the stadium is staggering. Charge it overnight before your departure and check it before you walk out the door.</li>
          <li><strong>Portable charger (power bank) fully charged.</strong> A power bank with at least 10,000 mAh capacity gives you one to two full phone charges. This is non-negotiable for any away-day that involves more than four hours of travel. Charge the power bank the night before alongside your phone. Carry it in an accessible pocket of your backpack, not buried at the bottom.</li>
          <li><strong>Charging cable.</strong> The power bank is useless without the cable. Pack the cable you use daily -- do not assume you will find one to borrow. If your phone uses USB-C, carry a USB-C cable. If it uses Lightning, carry that. A short cable (30cm) is easier to manage while walking or sitting on a bus than a full-length one.</li>
          <li><strong>Headphones for the bus.</strong> Overnight and long-distance buses in Latin America often play movies or music at volume. Headphones let you sleep, listen to your own music, or simply block out noise. Wired headphones are more reliable than Bluetooth on a long trip since they do not need charging.</li>
          <li><strong>Offline maps downloaded.</strong> Before you leave, download the offline map of your destination city in Google Maps or Maps.me. Stadium neighborhoods often have poor mobile signal due to the density of people on matchday. With offline maps, you can navigate even with zero data. Download the area around the stadium, the bus terminal, your accommodation, and the route between them.</li>
          <li><strong>Ride-hailing apps installed.</strong> Install the apps that work in your destination city before you arrive: Uber, DiDi, Cabify, 99 (Brazil), or whatever is dominant locally. Create your account, add a payment method, and test that the app works. Trying to set up a ride-hailing account at midnight outside a stadium with no data is a recipe for frustration.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency number saved in contacts.</strong> Save the local emergency number (911 in most Latin American countries, 190 in Brazil for police, 192 for ambulance) as a contact in your phone. Also save the number of your country's nearest embassy or consulate. If something goes wrong, you do not want to be searching for numbers under stress.</li>
          <li><strong>Location sharing with someone you trust.</strong> Before you leave, activate real-time location sharing with a family member or trusted friend via WhatsApp or Google Maps. This is a simple safety measure that costs nothing and provides peace of mind for both parties. If anything goes wrong, someone knows where you are.</li>
        </ul>

            Data Abroad
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you are traveling internationally, check whether your phone plan includes roaming data or buy a local SIM card or eSIM upon arrival. Airport kiosks and convenience stores near bus terminals sell prepaid SIM cards for 3-10 USD with enough data for a few days. Having mobile data makes everything easier -- maps, rides, translations, and communication with your group.</p>

        <p>Away-days are physically demanding. You are often sleep-deprived from an overnight bus, walking for hours in heat or cold, standing for the entire match, and eating at irregular times. A few small items in your bag can make the difference between feeling strong at the final whistle and feeling completely wrecked.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reusable water bottle.</strong> Dehydration is the silent killer of matchday energy. A lightweight, refillable bottle (500ml-750ml) lets you hydrate throughout the day without buying overpriced bottles at the stadium. Fill it before you leave your accommodation and refill at any restaurant or water fountain along the way. Note: some stadiums do not allow you to bring in bottles with caps -- check the stadium rules and be prepared to remove the cap at the gate.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel snacks (granola bars, nuts).</strong> Bus delays, late arrivals, and stadium queues can leave you without a meal for hours longer than planned. Two or three granola bars and a small bag of mixed nuts weigh almost nothing and prevent the kind of low-blood-sugar misery that turns a great day into a bad one. Eat a proper meal when you can, but always have a backup in your bag.</li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen for daytime matches.</strong> Afternoon kickoffs under the Latin American sun are brutal, especially in open stadiums with no shade over the popular sections. SPF 30 or higher, applied before you enter the stadium, protects you from sunburn that can ruin the next two days of your trip. A small travel-sized tube (50ml) is enough and fits in any pocket.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal medication.</strong> If you take any prescription medication, pack enough for the full duration of your trip plus one extra day in case of delays. Carry it in its original packaging with the prescription label visible, especially if crossing borders. Do not pack medication in checked luggage -- keep it in your backpack where you can always access it.</li>
          <li><strong>Pain relief (ibuprofen or paracetamol).</strong> Headaches, muscle soreness from standing, or general fatigue after a long bus ride -- a small strip of ibuprofen or paracetamol solves these problems quickly and costs nothing to carry. This is one of the most requested items among groups of traveling fans, and the person who has it is always the hero.</li>
          <li><strong>Earplugs for bus sleep.</strong> Overnight buses have engine noise, fellow passengers who snore, and occasionally a movie playing at full volume at 2 AM. A pair of foam earplugs weighing less than a gram can be the difference between arriving rested and arriving destroyed. Combined with headphones, they are your best weapon for sleeping on the road.</li>
          <li><strong>Sunglasses.</strong> Beyond comfort, sunglasses reduce eye strain during daytime matches and protect your eyes from dust and wind in open stadiums. They also help you look less obviously like a tourist scanning the environment nervously. A cheap pair is fine -- do not bring expensive ones to a stadium.</li>
        </ul>

                Your identification document -- whether that is a national ID or passport -- is the single most important item. Without it, you cannot board buses or flights, check into accommodation, or in some countries even enter the stadium. Always carry the original plus a photocopy, and keep a digital scan saved on your phone and in cloud storage. Everything else on the checklist can be bought or borrowed at your destination, but a missing ID can cancel your entire trip.

                No. The safest approach is to pack your jersey inside your backpack and only put it on once you arrive at the stadium area or meet up with other fans from your club. Wearing team colors on public transport, at bus terminals, or while walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods can attract unwanted attention, especially for high-tension derbies or rivalry matches. Travel in discreet, neutral clothing and save the jersey for the stadium.

                Calculate your expected expenses -- transport, match ticket, food, and drinks -- then add a 20 percent buffer for emergencies or unexpected costs. For a typical domestic away-day in Latin America, that means carrying between 40 and 120 USD equivalent in local currency depending on the country. Always bring a debit or credit card as a backup, but do not rely on cards alone since many street vendors, small buses, and informal ticket sellers only accept cash. Split your cash between two locations: some in your wallet and some in a separate pocket or hidden pouch.

                Absolutely. Your phone is your map, your ride-hailing app, your digital ticket, your emergency contact tool, and your camera all in one. On a full away-day, you will use your phone heavily for navigation, ordering rides, checking match updates, and communicating with friends. A long bus ride with no outlets will drain your battery before you even arrive. A fully charged power bank with at least 10,000 mAh capacity ensures your phone survives the entire trip. This is one of the most commonly forgotten items and one of the most regretted when left behind.
