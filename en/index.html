Carry cash in the local currency because many stadiums and their surroundings don't accept cards. Use public transit or ride-hailing apps to get around, and avoid wearing your team's jersey outside the stadium in cities with fierce rivalries. Our away-day guide walks you through every step with real logistics tailored to Latin America."

The key is doing your homework before you go: learn which neighborhoods near the stadium are safe, steer clear of flashpoint areas on matchday, and always try to move in a group. Thousands of fans travel across South America every week of the season without incident. At HinchaViajero we map the safe zones around every stadium and give you city-specific and rivalry-specific advice."

Never buy from strangers on social media or from street scalpers, no matter how desperate you are. If you use resale platforms, make sure they offer a refund guarantee and have a solid reputation. For international matches like the Copa Libertadores, tickets are usually sold through CONMEBOL or the host club weeks in advance. Our ticket guide lists every official sales channel for every major league and club on the continent."

A domestic away-day can run anywhere from 30 to 150 USD including transport, a match ticket, and food. If you're crossing a border, budget between 100 and 500 USD depending on the distance and the country. Overnight buses are the cheapest option for long-distance travel in South America, and they save you a night's hotel. In our guides, we break down real costs route by route, with budgets for backpackers and for those who want a bit more comfort."

We evaluate five key factors: stadium atmosphere, historical rivalry intensity, accessibility for away fans, the cultural experience surrounding the match, and overall value for money. Each factor is researched using real data and firsthand testimonials from fans who have lived the experience. A score of 85 or above means it's a must-do experience for any traveling fan."

Seek out the bars and zones where the visiting fans gather, which are usually a few blocks from the stadium in controlled areas. Don't provoke anyone, leave unnecessary valuables behind, and go easy on the alcohol so you can actually enjoy the match. If you're going with a group, pick a clear meeting point in case you get separated at the gates. In our pre-match guide, we list the best gathering spots for visiting fans in every major city."

We don't translate European guides: we write from the bus terminal in Lima, from the Colombia-Ecuador border crossing, from a pre-match bar in Barracas. Every guide includes public transport routes, up-to-date prices, safe zones, and the kind of intel only a fan who's already been there can share.

Cash is king at the box office and at the choripan stand. We map that reality: which buses to take, how to cross borders with minimal paperwork, where to change money without getting fleeced, which neighborhoods are safe to stay in near the stadium, and which ones to avoid on matchday. Real information for real travelers.</p>

                Start planning at least two weeks ahead. Research the host city, buy tickets only through official channels, and reach out to local fan clubs for support once you arrive. Carry cash in the local currency because many stadiums and their surroundings don't accept cards. Use public transit or ride-hailing apps to get around, and avoid wearing your team's jersey outside the stadium in cities with fierce rivalries. Our away-day guide walks you through every step with real logistics tailored to Latin America.

                Yes, it's safe if you take the right precautions. The key is doing your homework before you go: learn which neighborhoods near the stadium are safe, steer clear of flashpoint areas on matchday, and always try to move in a group. Thousands of fans travel across South America every week of the season without incident. At HinchaViajero we map the safe zones around every stadium and give you city-specific and rivalry-specific advice so you know exactly what to expect.

                Always buy from the club's official box office, their official website, or authorized points of sale. Never buy from strangers on social media or from street scalpers, no matter how desperate you are. If you use resale platforms, make sure they offer a refund guarantee and have a verifiable track record. For international matches like the Copa Libertadores, tickets are usually sold through CONMEBOL or the host club weeks in advance. Our ticket guide lists every official sales channel for every major league and club across the continent.

                The cost varies widely depending on the destination and how you like to travel. A domestic away-day can run anywhere from 30 to 150 USD including transport, a match ticket, and food. If you're crossing a border, budget between 100 and 500 USD depending on the distance and the country. Overnight buses are the cheapest option for long-distance travel in South America, and they save you a night at a hotel. In our guides, we break down real costs route by route, with budgets for backpackers and for those who want a bit more comfort.

                The pre-match is a sacred part of the experience, but you need to know where and how to enjoy it. Seek out the bars and zones where the visiting fans gather, which are usually a few blocks from the stadium in controlled areas. Don't provoke anyone, leave unnecessary valuables at the hotel, and pace yourself on the drinks so you can actually enjoy the match. If you're going with a group, agree on a clear meeting point in case you get separated at the gates. In our pre-match guide, we list the best gathering spots for visiting fans in every major city across the continent.

            <h2 class="feature-row__title">Made by fans, for fans</h2>
            <p class="feature-row__text">HinchaViajero was born from a simple frustration: there was no platform in Spanish that covered the traveling fan's journey with real logistics. English-language guides talk about European trains and contactless payments. We talk about sleeper buses, cash at the border, and how to find your way to La Bombonera without getting lost. We're a team of traveling fans from all across Latin America who document every route, every stadium, and every pre-match so you can travel smarter.</p>
