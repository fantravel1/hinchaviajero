Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or DiDi to get to and from the stadium, avoid wearing opposing team colors in heavily partisan neighborhoods, and keep your valuables secure. Since 2022, Liga MX has implemented stricter security protocols including Fan ID requirements at some venues. Stick to well-lit and populated areas around the stadium."

For lower-risk regular season games, some stadiums still have visiting sections, but availability varies by club and by match. Check the specific club's official announcements before planning an away trip. You can always attend as a neutral spectator in the general sections."

      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Liga MX — The Most-Watched League in the Americas</h2>

        <p>If you ask most football fans in North and Central America which league they follow most passionately, the answer is not the Premier League, not MLS, and not the Bundesliga. It is Liga MX. Mexico's top-flight football division is the most-watched football league in the entire Western Hemisphere, regularly drawing higher television audiences than any other domestic competition across North, Central, and South America. With over 100 million viewers per season spread across Mexico, the United States, and beyond, Liga MX is not just a football league — it is a cultural institution that defines weekends, shapes identities, and gives millions of people a reason to gather, argue, celebrate, and suffer together.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1943 as the Primera Division, Liga MX has evolved into one of the most competitive and well-organized leagues in the Americas. It features 18 clubs spread across Mexico, from the massive metropolitan centers of Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey to smaller but fiercely passionate cities like Leon, Toluca, Tijuana, and Puebla. The league operates on the Apertura/Clausura system — two short tournaments per year, each crowned by a dramatic playoff system called the Liguilla that produces some of the most intense football atmospheres you will find anywhere on earth.</p>

        <p>For the traveling fan, Liga MX represents an extraordinary opportunity. Mexico's football infrastructure is modern, its transport network is reliable and affordable, ticket prices are accessible (starting as low as $10 USD for general admission), and the country itself is one of the richest cultural destinations in the Americas. Whether you are a Latin American fan crossing the border to experience Mexican football for the first time, a North American fan looking for the most authentic football experience within driving distance, or a European or Asian fan seeking something completely different from what you know, Liga MX delivers. The stadiums are large (many holding 30,000 to 87,000 fans), the atmospheres are passionate, the food at the stadium is world-class (this is Mexico, after all), and the matchday experience blends modern organization with raw Latin American football passion.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Liga MX is the perfect balance. It has the passion of South American football with the infrastructure of a modern league. You get the atmosphere, the derbies, the drama — but the stadiums are safe, the transport works, and the tacos outside the ground are the best meal you will have all week." — Traveling fan from Colombia</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This guide covers everything you need to know to attend Liga MX as a traveling fan: the format and calendar, how to buy tickets, how to get around Mexico, the best derbies to prioritize, city-by-city breakdowns for the major football hubs, budget planning, safety advice, and the unmissable experience of attending a Liguilla playoff match. By the end, you will have a complete plan for your Mexican football adventure.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: 18 TEAMS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="teams">The 18 Teams of Liga MX</h2>

        <p>Liga MX consists of 18 clubs, each with its own identity, stadium, and fanbase. Understanding the geography and character of each club is essential for planning your trip — it tells you which cities to visit, which matchups to prioritize, and what kind of atmosphere to expect. Here is a breakdown of every team in the league, organized by the key football cities of Mexico.</p>

        <h3 id="cdmx-clubs">Mexico City (CDMX) — 4 Clubs</h3>

        <p><strong>Club America:</strong> The most successful and most polarizing club in Mexican football history. Based at the colossal Estadio Azteca (capacity 87,523), America is either the club you love or the club you love to hate. Nicknamed "Las Aguilas" (The Eagles), they have won more league titles than any other Mexican club. The Azteca on a big night is a bucket-list experience — the sheer scale of the stadium, combined with the yellow wave of America fans, creates an atmosphere that is unique in North American football. Getting there: the Azteca is accessible via Metro Line 2 (Tasquena direction) to the Estadio Azteca station.</p>

        <p><strong>Cruz Azul:</strong> Known as "La Maquina" (The Machine), Cruz Azul is famous for its passionate fanbase and its historically painful relationship with close defeats in finals — a narrative that became part of Mexican football folklore before they finally broke through. They play at the Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes (capacity 36,523) in the Benito Juarez borough. The stadium is well-connected by metro and sits in a central, accessible area of the city.</p>

        <p><strong>Pumas UNAM:</strong> The club of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Pumas carry an intellectual and countercultural identity that sets them apart. Their home is the Estadio Olimpico Universitario (capacity 52,000), a UNESCO World Heritage-listed stadium within the UNAM campus. The setting is extraordinary — murals, green spaces, and the energy of university life surround the ground. Metro University station (Line 3) gets you there.</p>

        <p><strong>Atletico de San Luis (note: recently promoted clubs shift, but CDMX historically hosts these three plus one rotation).</strong> The key point for travelers: Mexico City alone gives you four potential Liga MX matches on any given weekend, making it the single best base for a football trip to Mexico.</p>

        <h3 id="guadalajara-clubs">Guadalajara — 2 Clubs</h3>

        <p><strong>Chivas (Club Deportivo Guadalajara):</strong> The most popular club in Mexico by number of fans, and the only Liga MX team that exclusively fields Mexican players — no foreign players allowed. This policy, known as "cantera pura," gives Chivas a unique national identity. They play at the Estadio Akron (capacity 49,850), a modern, privately owned stadium on the outskirts of the city. Chivas vs. America is the Clasico Nacional — the biggest match in Mexican football.</p>

        <p><strong>Atlas:</strong> Guadalajara's second club, known as "Los Zorros" (The Foxes). Historically in the shadow of Chivas, Atlas captured two consecutive titles in 2021-2022 and reignited their fanbase. They play at the Estadio Jalisco (capacity 55,023), a classic older stadium with tremendous atmosphere. The Guadalajara derby between Chivas and Atlas — the Clasico Tapatio — is a fiercely local affair.</p>

        <h3 id="monterrey-clubs">Monterrey — 2 Clubs</h3>

        <p><strong>Tigres UANL:</strong> One of the richest and most successful clubs of the modern Liga MX era. Tigres play at the Estadio Universitario (capacity 42,000) and have invested heavily in international stars, making them a draw for neutral fans. Their supporters group, "Libres y Lokos," creates one of the best atmospheres in the league.</p>

        <p><strong>Monterrey (Rayados):</strong> The other half of the Clasico Regiomontano, Rayados play at the Estadio BBVA (capacity 53,500), one of the most modern and impressive stadiums in all of the Americas. Opened in 2015, the BBVA is a world-class venue that rivals anything in Europe. The Tigres-Monterrey derby is the most intense rivalry in northern Mexico and one of the best in the league.</p>

        <h3 id="other-clubs">Other Key Clubs</h3>

        <p><strong>Toluca:</strong> Based in the city of Toluca, just 65 km from Mexico City. The Estadio Nemesio Diez (capacity 27,000), known as "La Bombonera" (yes, the same nickname as Boca's stadium), sits at an altitude of 2,680 meters, giving Toluca a home-field advantage through thin air. An easy day trip from CDMX.</p>

        <p><strong>Santos Laguna:</strong> Based in Torreon, Coahuila. Plays at the Estadio Corona (capacity 30,000). Santos has a loyal fanbase in the La Laguna region and has been one of the most consistent clubs in the Liguilla era.</p>

        <p><strong>Leon:</strong> Located in the Bajio region of central Mexico, Club Leon plays at the Estadio Leon (capacity 33,943). A historically successful club with a passionate following, Leon is an excellent stop for fans exploring central Mexico.</p>

        <p><strong>Puebla:</strong> Based in the beautiful colonial city of Puebla, just two hours from Mexico City by bus. The Estadio Cuauhtemoc (capacity 46,612) is one of the larger grounds in the league, and the city itself is a UNESCO World Heritage Site well worth visiting beyond the football.</p>

        <p><strong>Tijuana (Club Tijuana Xoloitzcuintles):</strong> Based on the US-Mexico border, Xolos play at the Estadio Caliente (capacity 33,333). The most accessible Liga MX club for fans coming from the United States — you can literally walk across the border from San Diego and take a taxi to the stadium.</p>

        <p>Other clubs include <strong>Pachuca</strong> (the oldest football club in Mexico, founded in 1901), <strong>Queretaro</strong>, <strong>Mazatlan</strong>, <strong>Necaxa</strong>, <strong>FC Juarez</strong>, and <strong>Atletico de San Luis</strong>. Each has its own character and regional following that adds to the diversity of the Liga MX experience.</p>

            Planning Tip: Double-Header Weekends
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey each have two Liga MX clubs. This means you can potentially attend two matches in the same weekend in the same city — one on Saturday evening and one on Sunday afternoon. Mexico City is the best base for this since it has four clubs plus Toluca within easy day-trip distance, giving you up to five potential matches in a single weekend.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 3: FORMAT — APERTURA / CLAUSURA / LIGUILLA ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="format">Format: Apertura, Clausura, and the Liguilla</h2>

        <p>Liga MX uses the Apertura/Clausura system, meaning two separate short tournaments are played within each calendar year. This format, common across Latin America, creates twice the drama, twice the champions, and twice the opportunities for the traveling fan to catch high-stakes football. Understanding the format is essential for planning your trip at the right time.</p>

        <p><strong>Apertura (Opening Tournament):</strong> Runs from July to December. The 18 teams play a round-robin of 17 matchdays (each team plays every other team once). After the regular season, the top 12 teams qualify for a playoff bracket called the Repechaje (play-in round) and then the Liguilla (quarterfinals, semifinals, and final). The Apertura final typically takes place in mid-to-late December.</p>

        <p><strong>Clausura (Closing Tournament):</strong> Runs from January to May, following the exact same format. The 18 teams play another 17-match round-robin, followed by the Repechaje and Liguilla. The Clausura final is usually played in late May or early June.</p>

        <p><strong>The Repechaje (Play-in Round):</strong> After the 17 regular-season matchdays, the teams finishing in 5th through 12th place enter the Repechaje — single-elimination matches where the higher-seeded team hosts. The four winners advance to the Liguilla to join the top four teams from the regular season. The Repechaje creates sudden-death drama and excellent value for fans, as tickets are cheaper than Liguilla rounds but the intensity is real.</p>

        <p><strong>The Liguilla (Playoffs):</strong> This is where Liga MX transforms. The Liguilla consists of quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final, all played over two legs (home and away). The aggregate score determines who advances, with away goals serving as a tiebreaker. The atmosphere at Liguilla matches is on another level compared to the regular season — stadiums sell out, fan groups organize massive choreographed displays (tifos), and the tension is palpable. If you can time your trip to coincide with the Liguilla, do it. It is the peak Liga MX experience.</p>

        <p><strong>The Final:</strong> The Liga MX final is played over two legs, with the higher-seeded team from the regular season hosting the second leg. This matters enormously because the second leg is where the championship can be won at home — and the atmosphere of a Liga MX final second leg at a packed stadium is one of the most intense experiences in world football.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: CALENDAR ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="calendar">Season Calendar: July to May</h2>

        <p>Liga MX runs nearly year-round, with only a brief break in June and early July between the end of the Clausura and the start of the Apertura. This means that no matter when you visit Mexico, there is almost certainly a Liga MX match you can attend. Here is the full calendar breakdown to help you plan.</p>

        <p><strong>July:</strong> The Apertura kicks off, usually in the first or second week. This is a great time to catch early-season matches with full squads and new signings debuting. Stadiums are well-attended as fans are eager for football after the brief break. Weather in most of Mexico is hot and rainy (it is the middle of the rainy season), so expect afternoon thunderstorms that clear before evening kickoffs.</p>

        <p><strong>August - September:</strong> The heart of the Apertura regular season. Matches settle into a weekly rhythm, typically played on Wednesday evenings (midweek rounds) and Saturday evenings or Sunday afternoons. September brings the Mexican Independence Day holiday (September 15-16), and matches around this date often feature special celebrations and sell out quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>October - November:</strong> The Apertura regular season reaches its climax. Every match matters for Liguilla qualification, and the tension builds week by week. Derby matches during this period are particularly intense as clubs fight for playoff positioning. By late November, the Repechaje begins.</p>

        <p><strong>December:</strong> Liguilla month for the Apertura. The quarterfinals, semifinals, and final are packed into approximately three weeks. If you can visit Mexico in early-to-mid December, you can potentially attend multiple Liguilla rounds. The weather is cool and dry in most of the country — ideal for football.</p>

        <p><strong>January:</strong> The Clausura begins, usually in the second week of January. Early-season enthusiasm, fresh squads, and mild winter weather make this a pleasant time to attend matches. Mexican cities are still festive from the holiday season, adding to the atmosphere.</p>

        <p><strong>February - March:</strong> The Clausura regular season builds momentum. This is one of the best periods for a Liga MX trip — pleasant weather across most of Mexico, regular weekly matches, and manageable ticket availability since it is not yet playoff crunch time.</p>

        <p><strong>April - May:</strong> The Clausura reaches its decisive stages. Late April brings the Repechaje, and May delivers the Clausura Liguilla. Like the Apertura Liguilla in December, this is the peak of the Liga MX experience. May is warm and dry in most of Mexico, making it an excellent time to visit.</p>

        <p><strong>June - Early July:</strong> The inter-season break. No Liga MX matches, but this is often when the Mexican national team plays friendlies or tournament matches, which can be an alternative for football fans visiting during this window.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">Liga MX matchdays and kickoff times are frequently adjusted for television broadcasting. A match originally scheduled for Sunday at 12:00 can be moved to Saturday at 21:00 with relatively short notice. Always check the official Liga MX website or app for confirmed dates and times in the days before your planned match. Do not book non-refundable transport until the kickoff time is confirmed.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 5: GETTING AROUND — TRANSPORT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="transport">Getting Around: Buses, Flights, and Away-Day Logistics</h2>

        <p>Mexico has one of the best intercity transport networks in Latin America, making it straightforward and affordable to travel between Liga MX cities. Whether you prefer the comfort of long-distance buses, the speed of domestic flights, or the flexibility of driving, you have excellent options. Here is what you need to know.</p>

        <h3 id="buses">Long-Distance Buses</h3>

        <p>Mexico's intercity bus network is extensive, reliable, and affordable. For many routes between Liga MX cities, the bus is the best option — it is cheaper than flying, takes you city-center to city-center, and allows you to see the Mexican landscape along the way. The major bus companies to know are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADO and ADO GL:</strong> The dominant operator for routes in central and southern Mexico. ADO runs the Mexico City to Puebla route (2 hours, $10-15 USD), Mexico City to Veracruz (5 hours, $25-35 USD), and many other key corridors. ADO GL is their premium tier with wider seats, onboard entertainment, and snacks. Book at ado.com.mx or at the terminal.</li>
          <li><strong>ETN (Enlaces Terrestres Nacionales):</strong> Premium-tier bus service with large reclining seats, personal screens, and onboard meals. ETN operates routes like Mexico City to Guadalajara (6-7 hours, $35-50 USD) and Mexico City to Leon (4-5 hours, $30-40 USD). Ideal for overnight travel.</li>
          <li><strong>Primera Plus:</strong> Another reliable operator covering central and western Mexico. Routes include Guadalajara to Leon, Guadalajara to Aguascalientes, and connections throughout the Bajio region.</li>
          <li><strong>Omnibus de Mexico:</strong> Covers northern routes including Mexico City to Monterrey (10-12 hours, $50-70 USD), Monterrey to Torreon, and Monterrey to Saltillo.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For most Liga MX away trips, buses depart from one of Mexico City's four major bus terminals: Terminal Norte (northern routes), Terminal Sur (southern routes), Terminal Poniente (western routes, including Toluca), and TAPO (eastern routes, including Puebla). All four terminals are connected to the Metro system.</p>

        <h3 id="flights">Domestic Flights</h3>

        <p>For longer routes — particularly Mexico City to Monterrey, Mexico City to Tijuana, or Guadalajara to Monterrey — domestic flights are the practical choice. Mexico has several low-cost carriers that keep prices competitive:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Volaris:</strong> Mexico's largest low-cost carrier. Frequent flights between all major cities. Book early for fares as low as $30-60 USD one-way on popular routes.</li>
          <li><strong>VivaAerobus:</strong> Another budget carrier with ultra-low base fares. Based in Monterrey, they offer excellent connections to northern Liga MX cities.</li>
          <li><strong>Aeromexico:</strong> The full-service national carrier. More expensive but includes baggage and better schedules. Useful when you need flexibility or are booking last-minute.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Key flight times: Mexico City to Monterrey (1.5 hours), Mexico City to Guadalajara (1 hour), Mexico City to Tijuana (3 hours), Guadalajara to Monterrey (1.5 hours). If you book 2-4 weeks in advance on Volaris or VivaAerobus, round-trip fares on these routes typically run $60-120 USD.</p>

        <h3 id="local-transport">Getting to the Stadium</h3>

        <p>Once you are in the city, getting to the stadium is straightforward in most Liga MX cities. Mexico City's Metro system reaches or comes close to the Estadio Azteca, Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes, and the Estadio Olimpico Universitario. In Guadalajara and Monterrey, ride-hailing apps (Uber and DiDi both operate widely in Mexico) are the most convenient option. Budget $3-10 USD for a ride-hail trip to the stadium from most central locations in any Liga MX city.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="tickets">Tickets: $10-50 USD and How to Buy Them</h2>

        <p>One of the greatest advantages of Liga MX for the traveling fan is the affordability of tickets. Unlike European leagues where matchday tickets can cost $50-200 USD even for regular season matches, Liga MX offers genuine football experiences starting at just $10 USD. Even the most expensive seats in the house rarely exceed $50 USD during the regular season, making it one of the best value-for-money football experiences in the world.</p>

        <p><strong>Where to buy:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ticketmaster Mexico (ticketmaster.com.mx):</strong> The primary official ticket platform for most Liga MX clubs. Create an account, and you can purchase tickets online with international credit cards. Ticketmaster charges a service fee (typically 10-15% on top of face value). This is the easiest option for foreign visitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Club official websites and apps:</strong> Many clubs sell tickets directly through their own platforms. Club America, Chivas, Tigres, and Monterrey all have dedicated ticket sections on their websites. Some clubs offer discounts for buying directly rather than through Ticketmaster.</li>
          <li><strong>Stadium box office (taquilla):</strong> You can buy tickets in person at the stadium box office, usually starting a few days before the match and on matchday itself (if not sold out). This is a reliable option for regular-season matches, though Liguilla and derby matches may sell out before matchday. Bring cash (Mexican pesos) as a backup — some box offices do not accept international cards.</li>
          <li><strong>Convenience stores:</strong> Some tickets can be purchased at OXXO (Mexico's ubiquitous convenience store chain) or other authorized retail points. Check the specific club's announcement for each match.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Season tickets and abonos:</strong> If you plan to attend multiple matches of the same club, some clubs offer season passes (abonos) that provide significant savings. These are especially common for America, Chivas, Tigres, and Cruz Azul. However, for a visiting fan attending just one or two matches, individual tickets are the practical choice.</p>

            Avoid Scalpers
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Never buy tickets from scalpers (revendedores) outside the stadium or from unauthorized sellers on social media. Counterfeit and duplicate tickets are a real risk, especially for Liguilla matches and derbies. If someone outside the stadium is offering tickets at suspiciously low prices — or suspiciously high prices with a story about "last ones available" — walk away. Only purchase through official channels. Read our full <a href="../guides/tickets-without-scams.html">Tickets Without Scams guide</a> for detailed advice.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 7: BEST DERBIES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="derbies">The Best Derbies in Liga MX</h2>

        <p>Derbies are the heartbeat of any football league, and Liga MX has some of the most intense rivalries in the Americas. If you can time your visit to coincide with one of these matches, you will experience Mexican football at its absolute peak. Here are the three derbies every traveling fan should prioritize.</p>

        <h3 id="clasico-nacional">Clasico Nacional: America vs. Chivas</h3>

        <p>The biggest match in Mexican football. Full stop. The rivalry between Club America (Mexico City) and Chivas (Guadalajara) transcends football — it is a clash of identities, philosophies, and regional pride that has divided Mexican families for generations. America, the capital-city powerhouse funded by the Televisa media empire, represents establishment wealth and national reach. Chivas, with their all-Mexican player policy and Guadalajara roots, represent provincial pride, tradition, and anti-establishment defiance.</p>

        <p>The Clasico Nacional is played twice per tournament (home and away), meaning four times per year during the regular season alone, plus potential Liguilla meetings. When these two meet at the Estadio Azteca with 87,000 fans, or at the Estadio Akron with 50,000, the atmosphere is extraordinary. Expect wall-to-wall chanting, massive tifo displays, smoke, confetti, and an emotional intensity that few football rivalries anywhere in the world can match. Tickets for the Clasico Nacional sell out fast — buy the moment they go on sale, ideally through Ticketmaster Mexico or the host club's platform.</p>

        <h3 id="clasico-capitalino">Clasico Capitalino: America vs. Cruz Azul (and Pumas)</h3>

        <p>Mexico City's internal rivalry. The Clasico Capitalino traditionally refers to America vs. Cruz Azul, but the broader web of CDMX football rivalries includes America vs. Pumas and Cruz Azul vs. Pumas. Any combination of these three clubs facing each other in the capital creates a charged atmosphere. The America-Cruz Azul rivalry has a deep working-class vs. establishment dimension, while America-Pumas carries an anti-intellectual vs. university-educated overtone. These matches are incredibly accessible for the traveling fan since they are all played within Mexico City — no intercity travel required. The Metro can get you to any of these three stadiums. Tickets are more available than for the Clasico Nacional, typically ranging from $15-35 USD.</p>

        <h3 id="clasico-regiomontano">Clasico Regiomontano: Tigres vs. Monterrey</h3>

        <p>The fiercest rivalry in northern Mexico. Tigres UANL vs. Monterrey (Rayados) is a derby fueled by the industrial city's intense local pride, corporate investment (both clubs are backed by major Mexican corporations), and a genuine hatred between the two fanbases that goes beyond sport. The Clasico Regiomontano has produced some of the most dramatic moments in Liga MX history, particularly in Liguilla meetings.</p>

        <p>What makes this derby special for the traveling fan is the stadium quality. The Estadio BBVA (Monterrey's home) is arguably the best football stadium in Mexico and one of the best in the Americas — a modern marvel with excellent sightlines, comfortable seating, and an atmosphere that amplifies every chant. The Estadio Universitario (Tigres' home) is older but has a raw, visceral energy that the BBVA's modernity cannot replicate. If you can attend both legs of a Clasico Regiomontano (one at each stadium), you will have experienced two radically different but equally memorable atmospheres.</p>

            Derby Tip
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">The Liga MX schedule is published at the start of each Apertura and Clausura. As soon as the schedule is released, identify the dates of the Clasico Nacional, Clasico Capitalino, and Clasico Regiomontano and plan your trip around them. These are the matches that sell out first, and the atmosphere is dramatically different from a regular-season match between mid-table teams. A derby night in Liga MX is worth building an entire trip around.</p>

        <h2 id="budget">Budget: Liga MX is Remarkably Affordable</h2>

        <p>Mexico is one of the most affordable football destinations in the world for traveling fans, and Liga MX offers extraordinary value compared to European or even other Latin American leagues. The combination of cheap tickets, affordable food, reasonable transport, and a favorable exchange rate for visitors from the US, Canada, or Europe makes a Liga MX trip accessible to almost any budget.</p>

        <p><strong>A typical matchday budget (per person):</strong></p>

        </div>

        <p><strong>Budget-tier reality:</strong> It is genuinely possible to attend a Liga MX match for under $30 USD total if you are staying in a hostel, taking the Metro to the stadium, eating street food, and buying a general admission ticket. This is remarkable for a top-flight football league. A taco al pastor outside the stadium costs $1-2 USD, a beer from a street vendor costs $1-3 USD, and Metro tickets in CDMX cost less than $0.30 USD. Mexico rewards the budget traveler more than almost any other football destination.</p>

        <p><strong>Weekend trip budget:</strong> A full weekend trip from the US border (flying from a major US city) to attend a Liga MX match in CDMX, Guadalajara, or Monterrey can be done for $200-400 USD total including round-trip flight, two nights' accommodation, match ticket, food, and local transport. From within Mexico, a bus trip to an away match in a neighboring city can cost as little as $50-80 USD all-in.</p>

        <p><strong>Liguilla premium:</strong> Expect costs to increase by 50-100% during the Liguilla. Ticket prices rise, and hotel demand in host cities increases. Even so, a Liguilla match remains far more affordable than equivalent playoff football in Europe or the US. A quarterfinal ticket in a premium section will set you back $50-80 USD — less than a regular-season nosebleed seat at many Premier League or NFL stadiums.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">Eat outside the stadium, not inside. While stadium food in Mexico is better than most countries, the real culinary experience is at the taco stands, torta vendors, and elote carts that line the streets around every Liga MX stadium on matchday. The food is better, cheaper, and more authentically Mexican. Arrive 60-90 minutes before kickoff, eat your fill of street food, and enter the stadium satisfied. Your wallet — and your taste buds — will thank you.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 9: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety for Traveling Fans</h2>

        <p>Safety is a legitimate concern for any traveler to Mexico, and it is important to address it directly. The reality is nuanced: Mexico's major football cities — CDMX, Guadalajara, and Monterrey — are as safe as most large cities in the Americas when you take standard precautions. Liga MX stadiums have modern security infrastructure, and attending a match is a safe experience for the vast majority of the tens of millions of fans who do so every year.</p>

        <p><strong>Stadium security:</strong> Liga MX stadiums have bag checks, metal detectors, and organized security at every gate. Since 2022, Liga MX has implemented stricter security measures across the league, including enhanced screening, increased police presence, and in some stadiums, Fan ID systems that link your ticket to your identity. These measures were introduced after a crowd violence incident at a Queretaro-Atlas match and have significantly improved the matchday security environment.</p>

        <p><strong>Visiting fan sections:</strong> An important note — since the 2022 security reforms, many clubs have restricted or eliminated visiting fan sections (barra visitante) for high-risk matches. This means that for certain matches, there may not be a designated away section. You can still attend as a neutral spectator, but you should not wear the away team's colors conspicuously. Check the specific club's announcements before your trip to understand the visiting fan policy for the match you plan to attend.</p>

        <p><strong>Getting to and from the stadium:</strong> Use Uber or DiDi to get to the stadium. Both apps work reliably in all Liga MX cities and eliminate the risks associated with unofficial taxis. After the match, move away from the immediate stadium area before requesting your ride — surge pricing and congestion are worst directly outside the gates. Walk 10-15 minutes in the direction of the nearest major avenue, then request your ride. In Mexico City, the Metro is a safe and efficient option for getting to matches at Azteca, CU, or Ciudad de los Deportes.</p>

        <p><strong>General city safety:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stay in well-known neighborhoods: Roma, Condesa, Polanco, or Centro Historico in CDMX; Zona Rio or Chapultepec in Guadalajara; San Pedro Garza Garcia or Valle in Monterrey.</li>
          <li>Use ride-hailing apps for all transport after dark.</li>
          <li>Keep your phone and wallet secure and out of sight in crowded areas.</li>
          <li>Do not flash expensive jewelry, cameras, or electronics around the stadium.</li>
          <li>Travel in groups when walking to and from the stadium at night.</li>
          <li>Carry a photocopy of your passport and leave the original in your hotel safe.</li>
          <li>Have the local emergency number saved: 911 (Mexico uses 911 like the US).</li>
        </ul>

            Alcohol and Matchday
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Many Liga MX stadiums have restrictions on alcohol sales during matches, and some prohibit alcohol entirely inside the venue. Even where alcohol is sold, it is typically limited to beer and restricted to certain sections or time windows (often only during the first half). Plan accordingly — if you want to have a drink before the match, do so at a bar or restaurant near the stadium before entering. Never try to bring alcohol into a Liga MX stadium; it will be confiscated at the gate, and you may be denied entry.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 10: KEY CITIES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="key-cities">Key Cities for a Liga MX Trip</h2>

        <p>While Liga MX teams are spread across the country, three cities stand out as the essential hubs for the traveling football fan. Each offers multiple clubs, world-class stadiums, excellent infrastructure, and enough to do beyond football to fill a multi-day visit.</p>

        <h3 id="cdmx-guide">Mexico City (CDMX)</h3>

        <p>The undisputed football capital of Mexico. With four Liga MX clubs and five stadiums (including Toluca within day-trip distance), Mexico City is the single best destination for a Liga MX trip. You could spend an entire week in CDMX and attend a different match every few days.</p>

        <p><strong>Football:</strong> The Estadio Azteca is the crown jewel — one of the most iconic stadiums in world football, host of two World Cup finals (1970 and 1986), and home to Club America. The Estadio Olimpico Universitario (Pumas) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes (Cruz Azul) is centrally located and easy to reach. Beyond Liga MX, Mexico City regularly hosts national team matches and international friendlies at the Azteca.</p>

        <p><strong>Beyond football:</strong> CDMX is one of the great cities of the world. The historic center (Zocalo), the museums (the National Museum of Anthropology is extraordinary), the neighborhoods of Roma and Condesa, the food scene (from street tacos to world-class restaurants), the Frida Kahlo Museum in Coyoacan, and the ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan just an hour away. You will not run out of things to do between matches.</p>

        <p><strong>Accommodation base:</strong> Stay in Roma, Condesa, or the Centro Historico for the best balance of access to stadiums, restaurants, nightlife, and Metro connections. Hostel beds start at $10-15 USD; mid-range hotels at $40-70 USD per night.</p>

        <h3 id="guadalajara-guide">Guadalajara</h3>

        <p>Mexico's second city and the home of Chivas — the most popular club in the country. Guadalajara is a city of culture, tequila, mariachi music, and two passionate football clubs.</p>

        <p><strong>Football:</strong> The Estadio Akron (Chivas) is a modern stadium on the city's outskirts, while the Estadio Jalisco (Atlas) is a classic old-school ground in the heart of the city. Attending one match at each gives you the full range of the Mexican stadium experience — modern vs. traditional. The Clasico Tapatio (Chivas vs. Atlas) is a must-see if your dates align.</p>

        <p><strong>Beyond football:</strong> Guadalajara is the birthplace of tequila and mariachi, and the nearby town of Tequila (1.5 hours by bus) offers distillery tours that are worth a day trip. The Tlaquepaque artisan neighborhood, the Hospicio Cabanas (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and the city's vibrant food scene — especially birria (braised beef stew) and tortas ahogadas (drowned sandwiches) — make Guadalajara a fantastic destination beyond the stadium.</p>

        <p><strong>Accommodation base:</strong> Stay in the Centro Historico, Chapultepec, or Providencia. Hostels from $10-18 USD; mid-range hotels from $35-60 USD.</p>

        <h3 id="monterrey-guide">Monterrey</h3>

        <p>Mexico's wealthiest city and home to two of the most invested clubs in Liga MX. Monterrey is a modern, industrial metropolis nestled dramatically against the Sierra Madre mountains.</p>

        <p><strong>Football:</strong> The Estadio BBVA (Rayados de Monterrey) is, simply put, one of the best football stadiums in the Americas. Its modern design, steep stands, excellent acoustics, and 53,500-seat capacity make it a world-class venue. The Estadio Universitario (Tigres) is older but has a raw, student-section energy that the BBVA cannot replicate. The Clasico Regiomontano between these two clubs is the most intense derby in northern Mexico.</p>

        <p><strong>Beyond football:</strong> Monterrey is not a typical tourist city, but it has real charm for those who look. The Macroplaza, the MARCO contemporary art museum, the Fundidora Park (a converted steel foundry), and the dramatic Huasteca Canyon on the city's outskirts are all worth exploring. Monterrey's food scene revolves around carne asada (grilled meat), cabrito (roast kid goat), and machaca (dried beef) — meat lovers will be in heaven.</p>

        <p><strong>Accommodation base:</strong> Stay in San Pedro Garza Garcia (upscale), Centro (budget-friendly), or near Fundidora Park. Hostels from $12-20 USD; mid-range hotels from $40-70 USD.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">If you have 10-14 days, the ultimate Liga MX itinerary is: fly into CDMX (4-5 days, attend 2-3 matches including an Azteca experience), bus or fly to Guadalajara (3-4 days, attend a Chivas or Atlas match, day-trip to Tequila), then fly to Monterrey (2-3 days, attend a Tigres or Rayados match). This covers all three major football cities, all the key stadiums, and gives you enough time to explore each city's culture, food, and nightlife. Total budget for 12 days: $800-1,500 USD depending on your travel style.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 11: LIGUILLA ATMOSPHERE ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="liguilla">The Liguilla: When Liga MX Transforms</h2>

        <p>Everything written above about Liga MX applies to the regular season. The Liguilla is a different animal entirely. If the regular season is Liga MX at a simmer, the Liguilla is Liga MX at a full, roaring boil. The playoff system takes a league that is already passionate and turns it into something close to theatrical — a compressed, two-leg, win-or-go-home format where every goal, every foul, every decision by the referee can end a club's season in an instant.</p>

        <p><strong>What changes in the Liguilla:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Regular-season matches at mid-table clubs might fill 60-70% of the stadium. Liguilla matches sell out. Every seat is taken, every standing area is packed, and the energy is palpably different from the moment you approach the stadium.</li>
          <li><strong>Fan displays:</strong> The barras (organized fan groups) prepare massive tifo displays — giant banners, choreographed card sections, coordinated flag waves, smoke, and confetti. The visual spectacle of a Liguilla match at the Azteca, Akron, or BBVA is on par with the best fan displays in world football.</li>
          <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Liga MX fans are loud during the regular season. During the Liguilla, they are deafening. The chanting is continuous, the drums never stop, and when a goal is scored, the noise is physical — you feel it in your chest. If you have never experienced this level of sustained crowd intensity, the Liguilla will recalibrate your understanding of what a football atmosphere can be.</li>
          <li><strong>Stakes:</strong> The two-leg format means that every away goal matters, every defensive error could be fatal, and the lead can shift across 180 minutes of football plus stoppage time. The tension in the stadium during the second leg of a Liguilla tie, with the aggregate score level, is almost unbearable. It is football at its most dramatic.</li>
          <li><strong>City atmosphere:</strong> The Liguilla transforms not just the stadium but the entire city. Bars and restaurants are packed with fans watching on screens, cars honk in celebration after goals, and the entire social fabric of the city shifts to revolve around the football. In smaller Liga MX cities like Leon, Toluca, or Pachuca, a Liguilla run is the biggest event of the year.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>How to attend a Liguilla match:</strong> Tickets sell out faster than regular-season matches, so buy the moment they go on sale. Ticketmaster Mexico is the primary platform. For clubs with high season-ticket holder bases (America, Chivas, Tigres), the number of individual tickets available to the general public is limited. Be online and ready when sales open — which is typically announced on the club's social media 2-5 days before the match. If the first sale sells out, check for additional ticket releases in the 24-48 hours before the match, as clubs sometimes release held-back allocations.</p>

        <p>If you are planning a trip specifically for the Liguilla, the challenge is that the matchups are not known until the regular season ends. You can mitigate this by: (1) choosing a city with two clubs (CDMX, Guadalajara, Monterrey), which doubles your chances of that city hosting a Liguilla match; (2) planning your trip for the quarterfinal round when eight teams are still involved, maximizing the probability of finding a match; and (3) keeping your bookings refundable or flexible in case the schedule shifts.</p>

For high-demand matches like the Clasico Nacional or Liguilla playoffs, buy the moment tickets go on sale. Prices range from $10 to $50 USD for regular season matches. Avoid unofficial resellers and scalpers outside the stadium. Some clubs also sell tickets at OXXO convenience stores. Arrive at the box office early on matchday if buying in person, as queues can be long for popular matches.

                Yes, attending Liga MX matches is generally safe, especially in major cities like CDMX, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Stadiums have modern infrastructure and organized security, including bag checks, metal detectors, and dedicated security personnel. Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or DiDi to get to and from the stadium, avoid wearing opposing team colors in heavily partisan neighborhoods, and keep your valuables secure. Since 2022, Liga MX has implemented stricter security protocols including Fan ID requirements at some venues. Stick to well-lit and populated areas around the stadium, travel in groups after night matches, and follow the general safety advice in our <a href="../guides/matchday-safety.html">Matchday Safety Guide</a>.

                The most exciting time is during the Liguilla playoff rounds in November-December (Apertura) or May (Clausura), when the atmosphere reaches its absolute peak. For the best combination of weather and regular football, visit between September and November during the Apertura, or February to April during the Clausura. These windows offer weekly matches without the extreme heat of mid-summer or the rainy season downpours of July-August. Avoid late June and early July, which is the inter-season break when no Liga MX matches are played.

                Mexico is one of the most affordable football destinations in the Americas. A budget matchday can cost as little as $30-50 USD total: $10-15 for a general admission ticket, $2-5 for Metro or bus transport, and $10-20 for street food and drinks. Budget hostels in CDMX, Guadalajara, or Monterrey start at $10-20 USD per night. A full weekend trip including accommodation, two meals out, transport, and a match ticket can be done for under $100 USD if you are already in Mexico. For visitors flying in from the US, budget $200-400 USD for a complete weekend trip including round-trip flight on a low-cost carrier like Volaris or VivaAerobus.

                Liga MX's policy on visiting fans has changed significantly since March 2022, when a crowd violence incident at a Queretaro-Atlas match led to league-wide security reforms. Many clubs have restricted or eliminated visiting fan sections (barra visitante) for high-risk matches. For lower-risk regular season games, some stadiums still allow visiting fans, but availability varies by club and by match. Check the specific club's official announcements before planning an away trip. You can always attend as a neutral spectator in the general sections — just avoid wearing the away team's colors conspicuously, especially at derby matches or high-tension fixtures.

                Citizens of the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and most South American countries can enter Mexico visa-free for tourist stays of up to 180 days. You will receive a tourist entry form (FMM) at immigration, either electronically or on paper. Citizens of some Central American and Caribbean countries may need a visa — check with the Mexican consulate in your country before traveling. Always carry your passport with at least six months of validity remaining. For South American fans, Mexico is one of the most accessible international football destinations, requiring no visa for most nationalities.

                The food culture around Liga MX stadiums is exceptional — this is Mexico, after all. Outside every stadium, you will find street vendors selling tacos al pastor, tacos de suadero, quesadillas, tortas (sandwiches), elotes and esquites (corn on the cob and corn in a cup), churros, and more. Prices range from $1-3 USD per item. Inside the stadium, food options vary by venue but typically include hot dogs, nachos, hamburgers, and pizza at $3-6 USD. Our strong recommendation: eat outside before entering. The street food around Liga MX stadiums is not just cheap — it is genuinely some of the best food you will eat in Mexico. Pair it with a michelada (beer with lime, chili, and spices) from a street vendor and you have the perfect pre-match meal.
