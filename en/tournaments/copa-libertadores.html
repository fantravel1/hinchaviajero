      <!-- ===== SECTION 1: OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview: South America's Champions League</h2>

        <p>If European football has the UEFA Champions League, South America has the Copa Libertadores de America. But comparisons only go so far. The Libertadores is not a polished, corporate-sponsored spectacle beamed to 200 countries with identical camera angles and sanitized atmospheres. It is something rawer, more unpredictable, and more deeply embedded in the identity of an entire continent. It is the tournament that makes grown men weep, that bankrupts fans who travel to every away leg, and that produces nights of football so intense they become part of a nation's collective memory.</p>

        <p>Organized by CONMEBOL (the South American Football Confederation) since 1960, the Copa Libertadores brings together the top clubs from all ten member nations: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The name itself carries weight. "Libertadores" refers to the liberators of South America — Simon Bolivar, Jose de San Martin, Bernardo O'Higgins — and the tournament was conceived as a unifying force for a continent that shares football the way Europe shares nothing else.</p>

        <p>For the traveling fan, the Copa Libertadores represents the ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward. The challenge: navigating ten different countries, each with its own visa rules, currencies, transport systems, stadium cultures, and safety profiles. The reward: witnessing football at its most visceral, in stadiums where 60,000 people sing in unison, where paper confetti falls from the upper deck like snow, where the ground literally shakes beneath your feet when the home team scores. No other club tournament on earth delivers this combination of logistical adventure and emotional intensity.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"You don't explain the Libertadores. You survive it. And then you spend the rest of your life trying to get back." — A Colombian fan in Bogota, after Atletico Nacional's 2016 triumph</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This guide is built for the fan who wants to be there. Not watching on a screen in a bar, but standing in the away section at 3,600 meters altitude in La Paz, or sweating through a 35-degree night in Barranquilla, or crying in the rain at the Maracana after a stoppage-time winner. We cover everything: the tournament's format, its calendar, how to get tickets, how to plan your travel, how to stay safe, how much it costs, where the best atmospheres are, and the history that makes every match feel like it carries the weight of decades.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 2: FORMAT ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="format">Tournament Format: 47 Clubs, Groups, Knockouts, Single Final</h2>

        <p>Understanding the Copa Libertadores format is essential for planning your travel. The tournament is a season-long marathon, not a sprint, and the structure determines when and where you will need to be. Here is the full breakdown of how 47 clubs from 10 countries are whittled down to a single champion.</p>

        <h3>Preliminary Qualifying Rounds (February - March)</h3>
        <p>The tournament begins with three qualifying rounds played on a home-and-away basis. These rounds involve the lower-ranked entrants — clubs that qualified through domestic cup competitions or finishing positions rather than through automatic berths. Approximately 15 clubs enter these preliminary stages, competing for the remaining spots in the group stage. For the traveling fan, the qualifying rounds are a hidden gem: small stadiums, affordable tickets, minimal security hassles, and the raw drama of clubs fighting for the right to compete on the continental stage. If your team enters the Libertadores in the preliminary rounds, these away trips are the cheapest and most accessible of the entire tournament.</p>

        <h3>Group Stage (April - May)</h3>
        <p>Thirty-two clubs are divided into eight groups of four. Each team plays six matches — three at home, three away — across approximately two months. The top two clubs from each group advance to the Round of 16. The group stage is the backbone of the Libertadores calendar and the phase where the traveling fan has the most options. Your team will visit three different cities (potentially in three different countries) over six weeks. The variety is extraordinary: one week you could be in the thin air of Quito, the next in the tropical heat of Recife, and the next in the cold south of Montevideo.</p>

        <h3>Round of 16 (July - August)</h3>
        <p>Sixteen clubs remain, paired in home-and-away knockout ties decided on aggregate. If the aggregate score is level after two legs, the away-goals rule has been abolished — the match goes to penalties. The Round of 16 is where the tournament shifts gear. Atmospheres become more intense, ticket demand rises sharply, and the logistical stakes increase because elimination means your Libertadores journey is over.</p>

        <h3>Quarterfinals and Semifinals (August - October)</h3>
        <p>Eight clubs in the quarters, four in the semis — still played over two legs. These are the matches that define Libertadores legends. The stadiums are always full, the noise is deafening, and the quality of football reaches its peak. For the traveling fan, getting tickets at this stage requires planning measured in weeks, not days. Flight and hotel prices in the host city spike significantly.</p>

        <h3>The Final: Single Match at a Neutral Venue (November)</h3>
        <p>Since 2019, CONMEBOL has staged the Copa Libertadores final as a single match at a pre-determined neutral venue. The venue is announced well in advance (sometimes a year ahead), and the two finalist clubs receive ticket allocations from CONMEBOL. This format has transformed the final into a festival-style mega-event, with both sets of fans descending on a single city for 3-4 days of celebrations, marches, and pre-match gatherings. The final is the most expensive and most logistically demanding trip of the tournament, but also the most unforgettable.</p>

      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="calendar">Calendar: February to November</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores spans nearly the entire calendar year, from the first qualifying match in early February to the final in late November. This extended timeline is both a blessing and a challenge for the traveling fan. On one hand, you have months to plan, save, and schedule time off work. On the other, the unpredictability of the draw means you may not know your specific travel dates until a few weeks before each phase begins.</p>

        <p><strong>CONMEBOL's scheduling pattern:</strong> Group stage matches are typically played on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings, with kickoff times between 6:00 PM and 9:30 PM local time. Knockout rounds follow the same pattern. The final is held on a Saturday in November. CONMEBOL publishes the full group stage schedule approximately 3-4 weeks before the first matchday. Knockout round dates are confirmed 2-3 weeks after the previous round ends.</p>

        <p><strong>The gap between group stage and knockouts:</strong> There is usually a 4-6 week gap between the end of the group stage (late May) and the start of the Round of 16 (mid-July). This break coincides with international windows and domestic league schedules. For the traveling fan, this gap is your planning window — use it to study the knockout bracket, research the host city, and lock in transport and accommodation.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 4: AWAY-DAY PLANNING ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="away-day-planning">Away-Day Planning: Visas, Flights, and Logistics</h2>

        <p>Following your team in the Copa Libertadores means crossing international borders, navigating foreign transport systems, and landing in cities you may have never visited. The logistical challenge is what separates the Libertadores from any domestic league — and what makes it the ultimate away-day experience. Here is how to plan it.</p>

        <h3>Visas and Border Crossings</h3>
        <p><strong>For South American citizens:</strong> Thanks to Mercosur and CAN free-movement agreements, citizens of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia can travel between most South American countries using just their national ID card (DNI or cedula). No visa is required for stays under 90 days. Venezuela is the exception — entry requirements vary and should be checked independently.</p>

        <p><strong>For international fans:</strong> Citizens of the European Union, United States, Canada, Australia, and most Central American countries can enter most CONMEBOL nations visa-free for short tourist stays (typically 30-90 days). However, some combinations require advance visas — always verify with the specific country's consulate or official immigration website before booking travel.</p>

        <p><strong>Essential documents for every Libertadores away trip:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Valid passport or national ID card (check expiration dates well in advance)</li>
          <li>Match ticket or proof of purchase (border officials may ask your purpose of visit)</li>
          <li>Return bus or flight ticket (required at many land borders)</li>
          <li>Hotel reservation or accommodation address</li>
          <li>Travel insurance (strongly recommended — covers medical emergencies and trip cancellations)</li>
          <li>Photocopy of all documents stored separately from originals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Flights Across the Continent</h3>
        <p>Air travel is the fastest way to reach distant Libertadores venues. The key carriers for South American football travel are LATAM Airlines (the largest network across the continent), Avianca (strong coverage in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru), GOL and Azul (domestic and regional flights within Brazil), JetSMART (low-cost option in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia), and SKY Airline (low-cost Chile and Peru). For the best prices, book 4-6 weeks before the match. Use flexible fare options where available, since CONMEBOL schedule changes can force rebookings.</p>

        <h3>Overnight Buses: The Fan's Secret Weapon</h3>
        <p>For routes under 20 hours, the overnight bus is the backbone of Libertadores fan travel. A cama (fully reclining seat) or semi-cama bus between neighboring capitals costs a fraction of a flight and eliminates one night of accommodation. The Buenos Aires to Asuncion route, the Santiago to Mendoza corridor, the Lima to La Paz crossing, and the Montevideo to Buenos Aires ferry-bus combination are all classic Libertadores bus routes that thousands of fans use every year. Book cama class for overnight trips — the price difference over semi-cama is minimal and the sleep quality difference is enormous.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 5: TICKETS ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="tickets">Tickets: $20-200 USD and How to Get Them</h2>

        <p>Tickets are the most critical and stressful part of any Libertadores trip. The system works differently from European football — it is a mix of CONMEBOL mandates, club membership requirements, limited visiting allocations, and a dangerous black market you must avoid. Here is the full breakdown.</p>

        <h3>The CONMEBOL Allocation System</h3>
        <p>For every Libertadores match, CONMEBOL mandates that the home club must reserve at least 5% of the stadium's capacity (minimum 1,500 seats) for visiting fans. The visiting club receives this allocation and distributes tickets to its registered members (socios) through official channels. This means your away ticket almost always comes through your own club, not the host club or CONMEBOL directly.</p>

        <h3>How to Maximize Your Chances</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Become a socio early:</strong> Club membership ($5-30 USD/month) is practically mandatory for away tickets. Join before the tournament starts.</li>
          <li><strong>Set alerts:</strong> Follow your club's official social media and ticket office for sale announcements. Sales open and close within hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Buy immediately:</strong> Do not wait, do not comparison-shop. When tickets go on sale, buy the first available option.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider home section tickets:</strong> For group stage matches as a neutral, buying a home section ticket through the host club's website is an option — but you must not display visiting team colors or celebrate goals visibly.</li>
          <li><strong>Club travel packages:</strong> Many clubs offer official packages for knockout rounds that bundle the ticket with bus/flight transport and accommodation. These are often the most reliable path to a guaranteed ticket.</li>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 6: BEST ATMOSPHERES ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="best-atmospheres">Best Atmospheres in the Copa Libertadores</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores produces atmospheres that make the Champions League look like a corporate networking event. The combination of passionate fans, open-air stadiums, fireworks, confetti, non-stop singing, and the sheer desperation of continental knockout football creates an environment that overwhelms every sense. Here are the stadiums and fan cultures that deliver the most extraordinary Libertadores experiences.</p>

        <h3>La Bombonera — Boca Juniors (Buenos Aires, Argentina)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 54,000. The Bombonera does not just host football — it vibrates with it. The steep concrete bowl traps sound and amplifies it until the ground physically shakes. Boca's "La 12" ultras in the upper stands behind the goal produce a wall of noise that has been recorded by seismologists. For a Libertadores night at La Bombonera, the atmosphere begins hours before kickoff with fireworks, songs, and an emotional intensity that can overwhelm first-time visitors. If you only attend one Libertadores match in your life, make it a knockout round at La Bombonera.</p>

        <h3>Estadio Monumental — River Plate (Buenos Aires, Argentina)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 84,000. The largest stadium in South America and River Plate's fortress. On Libertadores nights, 80,000 fans create a "recibimiento" (reception) for the team bus that includes kilometres of flags, confetti cannons, and coordinated light displays. The scale is staggering. The Monumental for a Libertadores semifinal is one of football's most overwhelming experiences.</p>

        <h3>Maracana — Flamengo / Fluminense (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 78,000. The most famous stadium in South America, and when Flamengo fills it for a Libertadores match, the Maracana becomes the loudest place on earth. Flamengo's "Naciao" (Nation) has the numbers to turn any Libertadores match into a sea of red and black. The Maracana for a Libertadores final — as in 2023 — is a bucket-list experience for any football fan on the planet.</p>

        <h3>Estadio Centenario — Nacional / Penarol (Montevideo, Uruguay)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 60,000. Built for the first FIFA World Cup in 1930, the Centenario carries nearly a century of football history. When Nacional or Penarol play continental matches here, the old concrete bowl channels the noise in a way that modern stadiums cannot replicate. The atmosphere feels ancient and intense — a direct connection to football's deepest roots.</p>

        <h3>Estadio Atanasio Girardot — Atletico Nacional (Medellin, Colombia)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 45,000. Medellin's eternal spring climate (average 22 degrees) creates perfect conditions for an evening match. Nacional's fans are among the most organized in Colombia, producing coordinated displays and non-stop drumming. The compact design of the Atanasio Girardot keeps the noise close to the pitch, making it one of the most intimidating venues for visiting teams in the Libertadores.</p>

        <h3>Estadio Monumental Isidro Romero Carbo — Barcelona SC (Guayaquil, Ecuador)</h3>
        <p>Capacity: 59,000. The largest stadium in Ecuador and a cauldron of tropical heat. Guayaquil's 30-degree humidity combines with Barcelona SC's massive fanbase to create an environment that has broken many visiting teams. Night matches here are suffocating in every sense — the heat, the noise, and the relentless pressure from the stands.</p>

          <p class="info-box__text">The cheapest Libertadores destinations for traveling fans are generally Asuncion (Paraguay), La Paz / Cochabamba (Bolivia), and Quito / Guayaquil (Ecuador), where accommodation and food costs are significantly lower than in Argentine, Brazilian, or Chilean cities. If your team draws one of these destinations in the group stage, prioritize that away trip — your money goes further.</p>

      <!-- ===== SECTION 8: SAFETY ===== -->
      <section class="animate-on-scroll">
        <h2 id="safety">Safety for Traveling Fans</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores is intense, but it is not dangerous if you prepare properly. Thousands of fans cross borders safely for Libertadores matches every year. The risks are real but manageable — and they are entirely different from the risks of everyday tourism. Here is a practical safety framework for the traveling fan.</p>

        <h3>Before You Travel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research the host city:</strong> Identify safe neighborhoods near the stadium, locate the nearest hospital, and save the address of your country's embassy or consulate.</li>
          <li><strong>Share your itinerary:</strong> Give a trusted person your full travel plan — flights, hotel, stadium section, and expected return time.</li>
          <li><strong>Buy travel insurance:</strong> Make sure it covers medical emergencies, theft, and trip cancellation. Some policies specifically exclude "events involving large crowds" — read the fine print.</li>
          <li><strong>Register with your embassy:</strong> Many countries offer online registration for citizens traveling abroad. This makes it easier for consular staff to contact you in an emergency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>On Matchday</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Travel in groups:</strong> Never go to the stadium alone, especially for knockout rounds. There is safety in numbers, and organized fan groups provide structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow police instructions:</strong> In knockout rounds, local police establish designated meeting points and convoy routes for visiting fans. Use them — they exist for your protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your jersey in your bag:</strong> Outside the immediate stadium area, do not wear your team's colors. In unfamiliar cities, being visibly identified as a visiting fan can attract unwanted attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Use ride-hailing apps:</strong> Uber, DiDi, Cabify, or 99 (depending on the country) are safer than street taxis. Share your ride status with a friend.</li>
          <li><strong>Carry only essentials:</strong> Leave your passport, extra cash, and valuables at your accommodation. Carry a photocopy of your ID, your match ticket, and only the cash you need for the day.</li>
          <li><strong>Know your exit route:</strong> Before entering the stadium, identify how you will leave after the match. Plan your transport home in advance — do not figure it out in the chaos after the final whistle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After the Match</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wait before leaving:</strong> After a Libertadores knockout match, police typically hold visiting fans inside the stadium for 30-60 minutes while home fans disperse. This is standard procedure and is for your safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid confrontation:</strong> If your team wins an away knockout match, celebrate inside the stadium. Do not provoke home fans on your way out.</li>
          <li><strong>Have transport pre-arranged:</strong> A ride-hailing app scheduled in advance, a pre-booked taxi, or the organized fan bus back to the meeting point. Do not wander the streets around the stadium looking for transport after a late-night match.</li>
        </ul>

            Altitude Warning
          </div>
          <p class="info-box__text">Several Libertadores venues are at extreme altitude: La Paz (3,640m), Quito (2,850m), Bogota (2,640m). Altitude sickness can cause headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, and dizziness — all of which impair your judgment and awareness. Arrive at least 24 hours early, drink plenty of water, avoid alcohol in the first 12 hours, and consider coca tea (legal and widely available in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador) to ease symptoms. Do not underestimate altitude — it affects everyone regardless of fitness level.</p>

        <h2 id="history">History: From 1960 to Today</h2>

        <p>The Copa Libertadores de America was first played in 1960, inspired by the success of the European Cup (now the Champions League). Seven clubs from seven countries competed in that inaugural edition, won by Penarol of Uruguay. Since then, the tournament has grown into the most prestigious club competition in the Americas and one of the most revered in world football. Understanding its history adds layers of meaning to every match you attend.</p>

        <h3>The All-Time Winners</h3>
        <p>Sixty-four editions have produced champions from seven countries, with Argentine and Brazilian clubs dominating the roll of honor. The full ranking of multiple winners tells the story of South American football's power structures.</p>

        <h3>Independiente: The King of Cups (7 Titles)</h3>
        <p>Club Atletico Independiente of Avellaneda, Argentina, holds the all-time record with seven Copa Libertadores titles. Their dynasty in the 1970s — four consecutive titles from 1972 to 1975 — remains the most dominant stretch in the tournament's history. Known as "El Rey de Copas" (The King of Cups), Independiente's Libertadores legacy is the standard against which all other clubs measure themselves. Though they have not won the title since 1984, their historical record ensures that every Independiente fan carries the tournament in their DNA.</p>

        <h3>Boca Juniors: The Continental Giant (6 Titles)</h3>
        <p>Boca Juniors are the quintessential Libertadores club. Their six titles span four decades, from the late 1970s to 2007, and their La Bombonera stadium has become synonymous with Libertadores nights. Boca's record of reaching ten finals (more than any other club) speaks to their sustained continental ambition. For the traveling fan, following Boca in the Libertadores means joining one of the largest and most passionate fan mobilizations in world football — Boca's "La 12" have been known to fill away sections across the continent.</p>

        <h3>Penarol: The Pioneer (5 Titles)</h3>
        <p>Penarol of Montevideo won the first two Copa Libertadores ever played (1960 and 1961) and added three more titles across the following decades. As a Uruguayan club in a country of just 3.5 million people, Penarol's five titles represent an extraordinary achievement relative to the resources of much larger Argentine and Brazilian clubs. Penarol's Libertadores history is proof that passion and tradition can overcome financial disparity. Attending a Penarol Libertadores match at the Estadio Campeon del Siglo is a connection to the tournament's very origins.</p>

        <h3>The Brazilian Surge</h3>
        <p>Brazilian clubs have increasingly dominated the modern Libertadores. With Flamengo (2019, 2022), Palmeiras (2020, 2021), and Fluminense (2023) winning five of the last seven editions, Brazilian football's financial power and depth of talent have shifted the tournament's center of gravity. For the traveling fan, this means that a Libertadores journey increasingly involves visiting Brazil — the largest, most complex, and most rewarding football country on the continent.</p>

        <h3>Iconic Moments in History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1962-1963, Santos (Pele):</strong> Pele led Santos to back-to-back titles, establishing the Libertadores as the definitive test of South American club excellence.</li>
          <li><strong>1972-1975, Independiente's four-peat:</strong> The most dominant dynasty the tournament has ever seen. Four consecutive titles remain unmatched.</li>
          <li><strong>2018, River Plate vs Boca Juniors:</strong> The Superclasico final that was moved to Madrid after fan violence outside the Monumental. The most dramatic and controversial final in history.</li>
          <li><strong>2019, Flamengo vs River Plate:</strong> Gabigol's two goals in stoppage time at the Lima final. The most dramatic comeback in a Libertadores final.</li>
          <li><strong>2023, Fluminense vs Boca Juniors:</strong> Fluminense's first-ever title, won at the Maracana in front of 70,000 fans. A reminder that in the Libertadores, no club's time never comes.</li>

                A total of 47 clubs enter the Copa Libertadores each year, drawn from all 10 CONMEBOL member nations. Through three qualifying rounds, the field is reduced to 32 teams for the group stage. From there, 16 advance to the knockout rounds (Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals), leading to a single-match final between the last two clubs standing. The 47-team entry includes automatic qualifiers (based on domestic league performance) and preliminary round entrants (domestic cup winners and lower-placed league finishers).

                The Copa Libertadores runs from February through November — nearly the entire calendar year. Qualifying rounds begin in February-March, the group stage occupies April-May, the Round of 16 is played in July-August, quarterfinals in August-September, semifinals in September-October, and the single-match final is held in late November at a pre-selected neutral venue. CONMEBOL typically publishes the group stage schedule 3-4 weeks before play begins. Knockout round dates are confirmed 2-3 weeks after the prior round concludes.

                Ticket prices range from approximately $20 USD for standing sections in group stage matches to over $200 USD for premium seats in semifinals. Group stage away tickets typically cost $20-40 USD. Knockout round away allocations run $30-100 USD depending on the round. The final is the most expensive, with CONMEBOL-distributed tickets ranging from $100-500 USD by category. To access away tickets, you almost always need to be a registered member (socio) of your club. Sales open weeks before each round and sell out within hours during knockout stages. Never buy from unofficial resellers.

                Most South American citizens can travel between CONMEBOL nations using just their national ID card (DNI or cedula) under Mercosur and CAN agreements, with no visa required for stays under 90 days. Citizens of the EU, US, Canada, and Australia can generally enter most South American countries visa-free for short tourist stays. However, always verify requirements for specific country combinations, as some passport-nationality pairs require advance visas. Carry your passport (or national ID), proof of accommodation, return transport, and your match ticket at all times. See our <a href="../guides/border-crossing.html">Border Crossing Guide</a> for detailed logistics.

                Club Atletico Independiente of Argentina holds the all-time record with 7 Copa Libertadores titles (1964, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1984), earning them the nickname "El Rey de Copas" (The King of Cups). They are followed by Boca Juniors with 6 titles, Penarol of Uruguay with 5, and a group of clubs with 3-4 titles including River Plate, Estudiantes, Flamengo, Palmeiras, Gremio, Santos, Sao Paulo, Nacional, and Olimpia. Argentine clubs lead the overall count, but Brazilian clubs have dominated the modern era.

                Yes, with proper preparation. Thousands of fans travel safely across South America for Libertadores matches every year. The fundamentals: travel in groups, research the host city's safe neighborhoods beforehand, follow police escort routes during knockout rounds, use ride-hailing apps instead of street taxis, keep your team's jersey in your bag outside the stadium area, and carry only essential cash and documents on matchday. CONMEBOL and local police provide designated zones and convoy routes for visiting fans in knockout rounds — always use them. Read our full <a href="../guides/matchday-safety.html">Matchday Safety Guide</a> for comprehensive advice.

                The group stage (April-May) is the ideal entry point for first-time Libertadores travelers. Tickets are more available, transport and accommodation costs are lower, security is less intense, and you have three away matches to choose from. Pick the away match against the biggest opponent in your group — even a group stage match at La Bombonera, the Maracana, or the Monumental delivers a world-class atmosphere. The group stage also offers the widest variety of destinations, giving you the chance to visit a city you have never been to before. Build your Libertadores travel confidence here before attempting the high-stakes knockout rounds.

                Yes, but your options depend on the round and the specific match. For group stage matches, you can often purchase a home section ticket through the host club's website without being a member — these are the easiest tickets to get. For knockout rounds, home sections sell out faster and priority goes to members. If you attend in the home section, you must not wear visiting team colors or visibly celebrate visiting team goals. Some authorized sports tourism agencies sell packages that include Libertadores tickets and are a reliable option for international tourists. For the final, CONMEBOL sells a portion of tickets directly through its website.
